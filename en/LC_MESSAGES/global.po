"At the end of 1943, the German Army suffered defeat after defeat on the "
"Eastern Front. The Allies resumed escorting convoys in the Arctic to deliver "

"December 1943, only battleship Scharnhorst and a couple of destroyers "

"The 20th century rumbled in under thunders of naval gun fire. The outcome of "

"Japanese War—was effectively settled at sea. Based on experience gained in "
"those wars, navies of the world powers developed new technical "
"specifications for the major types of their ships.\n"
"\n"
"In armored shipbuilding, there was a shift towards battleships with eight to "
"twelve main battery guns of 305 mm or more in caliber, a new armor "
"protection system, increased speed provided by the adoption of turbines, and "
"improved resistance to flooding. The construction of such ships was a topic "
"of discussion in many countries. England, with its highly developed economy "
"and advanced shipbuilding technologies, took the lead. The Royal Navy's HMS "
"Dreadnought was a revolutionary ship which gave its name to the type. All "
"pre-dreadnought battleships abruptly became obsolete, plunging all world "
"powers into a new naval arms race in which only those countries with the "
"mightiest economies could prevail.\n"
"\n"
"In cruiser building, warships became ever more narrowly specialized with a "
"large series of high-speed cruisers created specifically for combat "
"operations within squadrons. Speed emerged as one of a warship's primary "
"operational characteristics. To achieve the desired result and maintain an "
"acceptable displacement, cruisers began to switch from coal-fired "
"reciprocating engines to steam turbines and oil burning.\n"
"\n"
"For destroyers, this process happened even more rapidly. Destroyers were to "
"be agile and fast enough to be able to reach the most advantageous position "
"and moment for an attack. The role of destroyers, according to the "
"experience of past wars at sea, had increased dramatically. Aside from "
"active operations in battles, they carried out their \"routine\", yet "
"important, duties such as reconnaissance, patrolling, and planting of mines. "
"For that purpose, destroyers began to be equipped with 102–120 mm guns. "
"The use of fixed underwater torpedo tubes was discontinued in favor of deck-"
"mounted multitube torpedo units placed on a rotating base. Ships were "
"equipped with devices for receiving and planting a large number of mines "
"from the upper deck. All this turned destroyers into a deadly threat for "
"surface ships of all types.\n"

"The chance to test those numerous new features in naval construction came "

"During World War I, the evolution of warships of the major types revolved "
"around the simple core idea of making them larger and stronger. The "
"increasingly large caliber of their guns was complemented by their ever-"
"stronger armor protection, which resulted in more significant water "
"displacement and bigger proportions. For battleships, the race was initiated "
"by the British when they designed a series of Queen Elizabeth-class warships "
"with a sharp increase in their main gun caliber (up to 381 mm). Germany "
"promptly responded with its Bayern-class super-dreadnoughts, which carried "
"the same super-heavy artillery. The German ships, however, outmatched their "
"rivals in terms of armor and combat durability. Their aim was to achieve "
"superiority in quality, as it was impossible to compete with or match the "
"sheer number of ships in the British fleet. Perhaps the only really "
"important novelty in this race for world shipbuilding supremacy emerged when "
"the Americans adopted \"all or nothing\" armor, not typical of warships of "
"the pre-dreadnought era, on their Nevada-class battleships. The new scheme "
"involved heavily armoring the areas most important to a ship, while the "
"remainder received significantly less armor to emphasize protection "
"optimized for long-range engagement. By a twist of fate, the strongest "
"battleships of that period were eventually built by Japan, a country that "
"had, until that time, stayed away from the main theaters of military "
"activity. Hardly any rival ship was on par with their Nagato-class warships "
"in terms of speed, armor and armament combined.\n"
"\n"
"During the war, only two European states could afford to build large series "
"of new cruisers—Germany and Great Britain. The trends were the same: when "
"the main caliber of the German cruisers reached 150 mm, the British "
"designed ships of the Hawkins class with 190 mm guns, which became the "
"prototype of a totally new subclass of ships—the heavy cruiser. The "
"Americans and Japanese, in turn, carefully considered their military "
"experience in relation to their own objectives. Built to scout for a fleet "
"of U.S. battleships, the Omaha-class light cruisers featured high speed for "
"cooperation with allied destroyers, and 152 mm guns to fend off any enemy "
"destroyers that might be sent their way. The Japanese, in turn, reinforced "
"their fleet of warships with several series of Kuma- and Nagara-class 5,500-"
"ton light cruisers. Any of the them could be used as both a reconnaissance "
"ship, and also as a command vessel for destroyer flotillas during massively "
"overwhelming torpedo attacks.\n"
"\n"
"Destroyers were undoubtedly the most active fighting ships during World War "
"I, which is why they would generally be considered the navy's expendable "
"assets. In addition to raiding operations, patrolling and mine laying, this "
"type of ship assumed another military role—anti-submarine warfare—which "
"resulted in corresponding changes being made to their design and armament. "
"The general trend, however, was the same: destroyers received ever more "
"weapons, and the caliber of their guns grew, along with their displacement "
"and speed. During the war, for the first time in the Royal Navy, a new sub-"
"type of ships appeared: destroyer flotilla leaders, the role of which "
"approached light cruisers in terms their characteristics and objectives.\n"
"\n"
"World War I demonstrated clearly that, during a global conflict, only a few "
"economically powerful countries that had steered clear of direct combat were "

"beyond their capabilities."

"The economic consequences of World War I were so devastating that even the "
"greatest winning states had to commit to something they once thought "
"impossible—conclude a treaty on the limitation of naval armament. From "
"1922, for the first time in history, naval officials and shipbuilders had to "
"be guided not by operational or strategic considerations, or optimal "
"technical solutions, but primarily by the articles of the Washington Naval "
"Treaty. This treaty contained restrictions on the number, displacement, and "
"armament for the major types of the vessels of war. In addition, Germany, "
"Russia, and Austria-Hungary ceased to rank among the naval powers at that "
"time. It is not surprising, therefore, that the \"Washington Treaty\" period "
"in the history of military shipbuilding turned out to be a rather difficult "
"one.\n"
"\n"
"Firstly, no capital ships were allowed to be built for a period of ten "
"years. At the signing of the treaty, the contracting powers retained their "
"most advanced capital ships in their respective navies. The only exception "
"was the Nelson class of British battleships built during that period. To "
"comply with the limitations of the Washington Treaty, these ships were of an "
"unusual design with all three main battery turrets carried forward of the "
"ship's bridge, an arrangement unlikely to be used under normal "
"circumstances.\n"
"\n"
"The Washington Treaty had a more profound effect on cruiser building. "
"Cruisers were limited in terms of quality, but not numbers. Since "
"battleships were no longer allowed to be built, the major naval powers began "
"a competition to build \"treaty cruisers\" using the maximum values for "
"technical specifications allowed by the treaty. To obey the limits on total "
"cruiser displacement established for each navy, designers were forced to "
"make compromises which normally affected armor protection. As a result, "
"during the second half of the 1920s, Great Britain, France, Italy, the U.S."
"A., and Japan possessed ships boasting a high speed, a 203 mm main battery, "
"and good seaworthiness, all at the cost of very weak armor. Warships of this "
"new subtype, the need for which was never dictated by any objective naval "
"warfare needs, were collectively known as the \"Washington Treaty Cruisers"
"\".\n"
"\n"
"The treaty for the limitation of naval armament likewise had an effect on "
"the brand new type of warship—aircraft carriers. In 1922, the number of "
"capital ships employed on fleet duties was sharply reduced. The hulls of the "
"newest battleships and battle cruisers, which were being outfitted at "
"shipyards, could either be scrapped, or converted into aircraft carriers. "
"This way, by the end of the 1920s, the U.S.A., Japan, and Great Britain came "
"to own large, high-speed aircraft carriers that were used to work through "
"basic design solutions and tactics that were later adopted on this type of "
"massively produced, purpose-built ship.\n"
"\n"
"The trends in the development of destroyers in the post-war years did not "
"change—their size grew, and their armament became deadlier. France and "
"Italy competed in creating ever larger and faster warships, equipped with "
"increasingly more powerful artillery, eventually blurring the line between "
"these ships and light cruisers. During the years of \"forced enthusiasm\" "
"for the construction of \"Washington Treaty\" warships, only a few ships of "
"this subtype were built. However, the real breakthrough came with the "
"appearance of the Japanese destroyers of the Fubuki class and their "
"successors—the Hatsuharu class. Powerful artillery, and most importantly, "
"the crippling long-range 610 mm torpedoes coupled with a unique system of "
"fast reload right at sea, propelled the destroyer forces of the Imperial "
"Japanese Navy to a leading position in the world.\n"
"\n"
"Meanwhile, as the shock from the world war passed, Germany and the U.S.S.R., "
"the heir to the Russian Empire, again sought to join the ranks of the "
"world's leading powers on land and at sea. For many signatories of the "
"Washington Naval Treaty, naval arms limitations became increasingly "
"difficult to put up with."

msgid "IDS_PCQM094_SHIPS_DESCR"
msgstr ""
"In the first half of the 1930s, Great Britain went to great lengths to "
"maintain and strengthen the system of international treaties for the "
"limitation of naval armament. Not because Great Britain had a natural "
"leaning towards pacifism, but rather because the weakening British Empire "
"could no longer confidently \"hold the trident of Neptune\". The two "
"conferences that took place in London in 1930 and 1936 modified the terms of "
"the Washington Treaty of 1922 by imposing additional limitations on the size "
"of, and on armament carried by, warships. Apart from that, a number of new "
"limitations were adopted which would, from then on, be applied to aircraft "
"carriers, destroyers, submarines, and all cruisers.\n"
"\n"
"All agreements reached earlier lost weight in many respects. Italy refused "
"to sign them, and Japan went as far as to withdraw from the naval treaties "
"entirely. Even attempts to include Germany and the U.S.S.R. in bilateral "
"agreements (based on the Washington/London Treaty system) also failed, "
"despite these countries striving to open an outlet to seas and oceans since "
"the mid-1930s.\n"
"\n"
"Nevertheless, the London Naval Treaties had a noticeable effect on military "
"shipbuilding. As Japan and Italy refused to join the Treaty of 1936, the "
"United States, France, and Great Britain added an escalator clause to "
"provide for a higher displacement limit to be applied to capital ships "
"allowed for construction. The limit on the caliber of the main battery guns "
"was also increased from 356 to 406 mm. However, the British designed and "
"laid down their new King George V-class battleships with the previous "
"displacement limit and 356 mm guns. The United States, consistently moving "
"towards the concept of fast battleships, managed to equip their new North "
"Carolina- and South Dakota-class battleships with 406 mm main battery guns. "
"But the most well-balanced ships of this type, taking into account the "
"treaty limitations, were built in France. Those were the ships of the "
"Richelieu class, equipped with 380 mm guns—a tit-for-tat response to "
"Italy for building its new Littorio-class battleships. Finally, the second "
"half of the 1930s saw Germany rushing into the select club of owners of full-"
"fledged modern battleships with its excellently protected ships of the "
"Bismarck class.\n"
"\n"
"Cruiser building suffered the most from the London Treaties. Subtypes of "
"heavy and light cruisers were identified, and the construction of the former "
"was initially limited, and later completely prohibited. This allowed Great "
"Britain to focus on the creation of light cruisers of the new generation "
"with a 152 mm main battery: the British Empire needed a large number of "
"such ships. However, the appearance of the most powerful Japanese cruisers "
"of the Mogami and Tone class with 155 mm guns, which, in fact, could easily "
"be replaced with 203 mm guns, urged the U.S. Navy and the Royal Navy to "
"boost the combat capabilities of their light cruisers. Perhaps the most "
"advanced heavy cruiser of the 1930s was the unique French Algérie, while "
"the most protected were the Italian Zara-class heavy cruisers. Among light "
"cruisers, the French ships of the La Galissonnière class were considered "
"the best in terms of cost and combat efficiency.\n"
"\n"
"As for the destroyers, in the second half of the 1930s, as well as the "
"powerful Japanese destroyers and fast French flotilla leaders, quite large "
"and well-armed new German destroyers emerged. Due to the existing treaty "
"limitations, the United States and Great Britain responded by creating "
"lighter ships with less remarkable characteristics and armament, but the "
"powerful shipbuilding industry made it possible to build them in "
"incomparably larger numbers.\n"
"\n"
"By the late 1930s, the treaty limitations were no longer effectively "
"complied with. The great powers were kept from an open, full-scale naval "
"arms race only by the bounds of diplomatic decency and budgetary "
"restrictions of peacetime. Those bounds, however, were abandoned with the "
"outbreak of World War II."

msgid "IDS_PCQM095_SHIPS_DESCR"
msgstr ""
"World War II overturned the entire system of limitations on naval armament "
"that existed in the 1920s and 30s, bringing international shipbuilding back "
"to its natural state. From that moment, every decision was dominated by the "
"need for warships, production capacities, technology, and time. It is not "
"surprising, therefore, that the United States was the only country that "
"expressed a wish to build a series of battleships laid down during these "
"years. Iowa-class battleships fitted perfectly into the new format of naval "
"warfare, changing their inherent role from hunting for high-speed Japanese "
"battle cruisers to ensuring the stability of fast aircraft carrier strike "
"formations. It is generally accepted that with all their performance "
"characteristics combined, they were the best battleships of World War II, "
"but this honorary title is contested by the Japanese giants of the Yamato "
"class. In contrast to them, the last battleship of the Royal Navy— "
"Vanguard—looked much weaker, despite excellent seaworthiness.\n"
"\n"
"A similar situation unfolded during World War II in cruiser building. It "
"was possible in this period to create well-balanced and powerful ships, but "
"only the United States and Great Britain had the resources to do so. The U."
"S. Navy received a large series of Baltimore-class heavy cruisers, the "
"largest of their type, as well as light cruisers of the Cleveland class. The "
"former were the strongest wartime heavy cruisers, balanced so well in terms "
"of armament, armor protection and seaworthiness that they remained in "
"service for many years. Their enhanced versions served as the basis for the "
"design of Des Moines-class heavy cruisers equipped with auto-loading main "
"battery guns, and embodied all the experience gained during World War II. "
"Armed with 203 mm main guns and representing the pinnacle of \"Washington "
"Treaty\" cruiser building, they were the best representatives of the latest "
"generation of heavy artillery ships. In the light cruiser type, they were "
"matched by the ships of the Worcester class, which also entered service "
"after the war and carried a battery of 152 mm automatic dual-purpose guns.\n"
"\n"
"The most massively produced surface ships of the World War II period were "
"destroyers, as they were involved in all impactful battles in all theaters "
"of military activity. But, despite mass production, the loss rate of this "
"type of ship was the highest. Unlike heavy artillery ships, new classes of "
"destroyers entered service during the war not only in huge series joining "
"the U.S. Navy (Fletcher, Gearing), but in large numbers in the Royal Navy, "
"and also in noticeable numbers in Japan (Yūgumo, Akizuki) and Germany "
"(various series of the 1936 class). After the war, the new artillery "
"destroyers were designed by those countries that could not afford to have "
"larger ships in sufficient numbers. Fortunately, in terms of displacement "
"and armament, the destroyers of that time often matched pre-war light "
"cruisers: the Battle and Daring classes of Great Britain, the Halland class "
"of Sweden, or the Friesland class of the Netherlands.\n"
"\n"
"The era when steam turbine-driven warships dominated the seas extended over "
"a short period by historical measures, only about half a century, almost "
"coinciding in time with the first half of the 20th century. It encompassed, "
"however, as many as several differing epochs. And all of their glorious "
"heroes are right here in World of Warships!"

"\n"
"USS Worcester and her only sister ship, USS Roanoke, were commissioned only "
"in 1948–1949, when World War II was long over. In total, four ships were "

"The early 1920s saw the start of development of a 40 mm multi-barreled AA "

"new gun had the same barrel as the Mark II, which is why it inherited the "
"pom-pom nickname. In 1935, a quadruple mount was designed which would become "
"the basis for the AA armament of British destroyers starting from the Tribal "
"class. The 2-pounder's rate of fire was around 100 shots per minute with its "
"effective vertical range of fire being just a little above 1 km and the "

"Armed with five small-caliber machine guns, the Blackburn Skua could carry "

"were two four-blade propellers with opposite rotation.\n"
"\n"
"Ordinary piston engines couldn't provide the required speed characteristics "

"The idea of creating a carrier-based, all-metal monoplane, capable of "
"performing the functions of both torpedo bomber and dive bomber, was first "
"suggested by the Fairey company in the early 1930s. However, the endless "
"stream of discrepant requirements from the Ministry of Aviation to change "
"the design delayed the work for almost a decade. As a result, when the "
"production of the aircraft, named \"Barracuda\", finally commenced in 1942, "
"its characteristics were far from impressive. The Barracuda II, which began "
"to enter service in the Naval Air Force in early 1943, was slightly better "
"with a more powerful 1,600 hp engine.\n"
"\n"
"The not-too-fast and not-very-maneuverable Barracuda didn't make for a good "
"torpedo bomber. But a number of constructive advantages allowed it to cope "
"well with the role of a dive bomber. The most striking moment of its career "
"was during operation Tungsten, which involved striking battleship Tirpitz, "
"hiding in one of the Norwegian fjords. On April 4, 1944, forty-two "
"Barracudas, coming in two waves, hit the battleship 14 times with their "
"bombs, losing only three planes in the assault. The battleship was put out "
"of action for several months. As the Air Force was obtaining American "
"Grumman Avengers—which surpassed the Barracudas in all respects—as part "
"of a lend-lease, the British aircraft became auxiliary planes, focusing "
"mainly on reconnaissance, the mining of enemy harbors and fairways, anti-"
"submarine patrols, and transporting."

"Laid down in January 1918, HMS Hermes was the world's first ship designed as "
"an aircraft carrier from day one of its inception. On the basis of the "
"results of trials held with her predecessors, ships converted from other "
"types, changes in the new project were made even at the final stages of "
"construction. As a result, the ship that entered service in early 1924 had "
"all of the features of a classic aircraft carrier: a closed hangar, solid "
"flight deck, and an island-type superstructure shifted to the starboard "
"side. The 11,000-ton HMS Hermes could carry two dozen planes onboard and "
"reach a speed of up to 25 knots.\n"
"\n"
"HMS Hermes spent most of her peacetime service in the Far East, looking "
"after the interests of the British Crown in the region. One of the tasks "
"that she had to perform—quite unusual for an aircraft carrier—was to "
"fight against pirates. At the beginning of World War II, Hermes, based out "
"of African ports, participated in the search for German raiders and blockade "
"breakers in Atlantic waters. In early 1942, she was assigned to the British "
"Eastern Fleet and arrived in Ceylon. In April of the same year, the Japanese "

"type—a light battlecruiser. When, two years later, Furious entered "
"service, she was a strange hybrid: on her bow she had a hangar with a flight "
"deck, while her stern was occupied by a turret with a 457 mm gun, a "
"monstrous weapon for its time. Furious would enter service three more times, "
"following another modernization that changed her appearance. By 1932, she "
"had been turned into an aircraft carrier with an island-type superstructure "
"and flight deck occupying three-quarters of her hull's length. She was "
"capable of accelerating to nearly 30 knots and carrying more than 30 "
"aircraft onboard.\n"
"\n"
"At the beginning of World War II, HMS Furious hunted German raiders in the "
"Atlantic. In the spring of 1940, she took an active part in the Norwegian "
"operation. Later on, her main goal mostly consisted of transferring aircraft "
"to various theaters of war, from the Arctic to Malta. In late 1942, she "
"covered the landing in North Africa and, in 1944, she participated in "
"striking battleship Tirpitz, based in Norway. A few months prior to the end "

"The King George V-class ships were the first British battleships to be "
"designed after the long break of 1922–1936, known as \"battleship vacation"
"\". They couldn't boast any outstanding tactical or technical elements.\n"
"\n"
"Due to ambiguities of treaty limitations, the 356 mm main battery was "
"selected, which turned out to be weaker than the guns of the new battleships "
"of other countries. Armor protection was not considered sufficient for the "
"necessary protection against 380–406 mm shells. The dual-purpose 133 mm "
"gun mounts, in reality, turned out to be of little use as an AA weapon and "
"the torpedo protection was deemed unsatisfactory. As a result of design "
"errors, the cruising range and seaworthiness left much to be desired.\n"
"\n"
"Nevertheless, battleships of the King George V class were built as a series "
"of five ships—the largest series in the world at the time. They entered "
"service at the right time, at the beginning of World War II. In real combat "
"conditions, the Royal Navy was able to use these battleships so skillfully "
"that they effectively coped with the objective of neutralizing Kriegsmarine "
"surface ships in European waters. It is symbolic that it was the lead ship, "
"King George V, that played one of the key roles in the sinking of as many "

"With all performance characteristics combined, the La Galissonnière-class "

"\n"
"Despite the fact that the main requirement for the project was a sharp "
"increase in protection at the cost of a slight decrease in speed, during "

"The sixteen destroyers laid down between 1934 and 1935 were created to "

"Dunkerque-class designs as much as possible to speed up the work. This "
"accounts for the ship's 380 mm main battery and general layout that "
"featured both of her quadruple turrets mounted on the bow.\n"
"\n"
"The result was not only the most innovative project of the so-called "
"\"treaty battleships\", the construction of which began in the second half "
"of the 1930s after a long break, but also one of the most successful and "
"well-balanced projects.\n"
"\n"
"The audacious solutions used for Richelieu proved to be quite justified. The "
"completely new type of boilers yielded great weight savings and gave "
"excellent output, working reliably to provide a speed of 31 knots. The "
"torpedo protection was the best in the world and matched the estimated "
"resistance. The armor protection system, artillery of 380 mm main guns, and "
"152 mm secondary battery all met the highest requirements.\n"
"\n"
"Perhaps the only weakness was the AA defense system. Richelieu was, of "
"course, inferior in combat strength to American battleships built in the "
"1940s, but not in terms of armor protection which could be compared to that "
"of Yamato, based on the best quality French armor. Therefore, any World War "

"Brooklyn-class light cruisers and replacing 152 mm guns with 203 mm guns.\n"
"\n"
"The hull inherited from the prototype provided better seaworthiness and "
"resistance to damage in combat. The armor thickness was increased, and, in "
"terms of armor protection, Wichita was superior to all previous American "
"cruisers. The main battery guns were placed in new turret mounts and the "
"anti-aircraft armament, consisting of the latest 127 mm AA guns, was "

"\n"
"The ship entered service in 1939, just before World War II began. The "
"outbreak of war in Europe canceled all contracts and allowed the countries "
"to return to the construction of cruisers armed with 203 mm main battery "
"artillery which had been banned since 1936. And it turned out that there was "

"gun was specifically developed for the ship, and in 1939, Congress approved "
"the construction of four such battleships at once, and two more ships soon "
"afterwards.\n"
"\n"
"Initially, the project was conceived as a high-speed variant of the South "
"Dakota-class ships, which had already been laid down, but the hull had to be "
"thoroughly redesigned. In terms of armor and anti-torpedo protection, Iowa "
"was almost similar to her predecessor. The new armament meant her main "
"battery guns turned out to be much more powerful. The dual-purpose guns "
"remained the same as those on the South Dakota-class ships. The small-"

"\n"
"The long history of the four Iowa-class battleships that were commissioned "
