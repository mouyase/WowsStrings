Cruisers, battleships, an aircraft carrier and a frenzy of destroyers.\\n\\n\\\"The Hunt for Bismarck\\\" collection consists of the badges of all major participants of the grand naval operation aimed at destroying the German navy's most powerful raider.","IDS_DESCRIPTION_PCZA003_DUNKIRK":"The Dunkirk Evacuation was one of the biggest battles of World War II, in which army, naval and air forces were fully involved. Within a few days, at the end of May and beginning of June 1940, more than 330,000 British and French troops were evacuated from Northern France. To save them, Allied forces had to sacrifice all equipment and most of their armament. Near Dunkirk, 2,472 guns and about 65,000 vehicles of the British Expeditionary Force and French Army were abandoned. For the evacuation, the British Admiralty called upon over 800 British, French, Dutch and Belgian war and civil ships.\\n\\nThis included about fifty destroyers, dozens of minesweepers, trawlers, passenger steamships, yachts, fishing boats, salvage and other vessels. One in four vessels was destroyed by the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine attacks, Wehrmacht artillery strikes and mine barriers. Within nine days of the evacuation, 145 British and 156 German aircraft were shot down in battles for air supremacy in the north of France. Winston Churchill said, 'Wars are not won by evacuations.' However, as a result of the Miracle of Dunkirk, the British Army was saved and was able to fight against the Axis powers on new battlefields, and the evacuated French troops formed the basis of the Free French Forces.\\n\\nFour years later, the Allies returned to France in triumph. The experience gained in organizing the large-scale troop transportation at Dunkirk was used during the Normandy landing in 1944. Later, Vice-Admiral Bertram Ramsay and Captain William Tennant, who were responsible for the evacuation in 1940, became the key figures on D-Day.","IDS_DESCRIPTION_PCZA004_YAMAMOTO":"It is easy to find a thousand soldiers,\\nbut hard to find a good general.","IDS_DESCRIPTION_PCZA005_HAPPYBIRTHDAY":"On September 17, 2017, the World of Warships Project celebrates its second anniversary.

Be very attentive—an achievement can be hidden virtually anywhere!","IDS_DESCRIPTION_PCZA006_HAPPYNEWYEAR2018":"At the end of 1943, the German Army suffered defeat after defeat on the Eastern Front. The Allies resumed escorting convoys in the Arctic to deliver equipment and armaments to the Red Army. All large ships of the Kriegsmarine gathered in Norway to prevent this. The British forces, with the assistance of the Norwegian resistance, were closely monitoring their location and movements, grasping every opportunity to incapacitate the enemy ships. In December 1943, only battleship Scharnhorst and a couple of destroyers remained combat-ready in Norway. To lure the armored beast from its lair, the Allies sent another convoy, JW-55B, on a course dangerously close to the Norwegian coast. A few hours from the convoy, the Distant Cover Force, headed by Duke of York, the flagship of the Home Fleet's Commander-in-Chief Vice Admiral Fraser, was steaming ahead, under the cover of a storm.\\n\\nMuch was at stake: the shattered reputation of the Kriegsmarine, the last capable battleship of Germany, and a strategically important line for aiding the struggling Soviet Union.","IDS_DESCRIPTION_PCZA007_HSF2018":"The crew of the Harekaze and the various characters that helped them in their journey.","IDS_DESCRIPTION_PCZA008_VIVALAFRANCE":"The French Navy traces its origins to the early 17th century.

For several centuries, it stood strong as one of the world's most powerful maritime forces. French shipbuilding contributed greatly to world engineering heritage by offering a large variety of ingenious discoveries and design concepts.\\n\\nThe crowning of French shipbuilding, the reflection of the country's proud history and its naval power were all manifested in French battleships. During World War II, alongside other combat units of the French Navy, these powerful warships accomplished a lot of important missions, facing tough challenges and suffering significant losses.","IDS_DESCRIPTION_PCZA009_AMERICAN_ARC":"U.S. Navy cruisers of the 1900s–1940s, awards and distinctive insignias of their crews.","IDS_DESCRIPTION_PCZA010_HAPPYBIRTHDAY2018":"Festive collection dedicated to the third anniversary of the World of Warships.\\nHundreds of ships are plying the seas already.

Ships under flags bearing St. George's Cross clashed with their enemy in vast expanses of the world's oceans, winning glorious victories and suffering bitter defeats. However, behind each bright chapter in this part of naval combat history lies hard, sometimes barely perceptible, day-to-day work.\\n\\nIn the 20th century, most of the labor was performed by destroyers. They kept watch without interruption for weeks and months, bravely confronted the elements of nature out on the high seas, and countered enemy surface ships, submarines, and aircraft. There existed hardly any other ships in naval history that could have undertaken such a varied range of combat tasks, and so numerous, as the Royal Navy and Commonwealth ships did during both world wars.","IDS_DESCRIPTION_PCZA013_HAPPYNEWYEAR2019":"The age of \\\"Their Imperial Majesties\\\" fleets, the heyday of battleships, the art of ramming stems and high masts.

Dreadnoughts replaced older battleships that had started to look rather poor in comparison with the more advanced steel monsters. Oil began to replace coal as fuel for ships, and each year more higher-speed battleships and battlecruisers, equipped with larger guns, were entering into service. However, it was the breakout of World War I in 1914 that put an end to the unconditional reign of dreadnoughts at sea. Pretty ironic, considering that this was the conflict in which these ships were supposed to prove their worth. The appearance of a new lethal weapon – submarines – had a significant hand in this, combined with the advancement of aviation, which also started to make its presence felt in naval marine affairs. The unprecedented warfare, lasting several years, exhausted the resources of both the defeated, as well as the majority of the victors. Plans to lay down the huge armada of steel monsters that were preparing to enter service were doomed.

The German battleship Bismarck, under the command of Admiral Lütjens, and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen went out to sea to break into the Atlantic and attack British shipping lines. On May 20, the neutral Swedish cruiser Gotland spotted the German ships. The British Admiralty learned of this through intelligence channels. The next day, the Royal Navy commanders received a photograph of the raid ships berthing in one of the Norwegian fiords and started regrouping their forces for interception. Bismarck and Prinz Eugen tried to break into the Atlantic, sailing round Iceland in the North. British forces were already waiting for them in the Denmark Strait. On the evening of May 23, the cruiser Suffolk established radar contact with the German ships. After a while, Bismarck shelled the cruiser Norfolk, commencing fire at the enemy ship from the main battery guns. Norfolk managed to avoid disastrous hits and hid behind a smoke screen.","IDS_PCQM042_DESCR":"At the end of May 23, the heavy British cruisers Norfolk and Suffolk steamed behind the German ships and continued to surveil them, avoiding their visibility range. Information about the location, course, and speed of the raiders was passed to the Home Fleet Commander Admiral Tovey. Two ships under command of the Vice-Admiral Holland were sailing ahead to intercept the Germans: the battleship Prince of Wales and the battlecruiser Hood, the pride of Great Britain's Navy. On the dawn of May 24, Lütjens' and Holland's ships met at the mouth of the Denmark Strait. The British started firing. Within the first six minutes, Prince of Wales hit Bismarck three times. The fifth salvo from the German battleship struck HMS Hood and caused the detonation of her magazine. After a horrible explosion, \\\"Mighty Hood\\\" was sunk with most of her crew.","IDS_PCQM043_DESCR":"After HMS Hood's wreckage on the morning of May 24, the battle in the Denmark Strait continued. Prince of Wales was left alone under the concentrated fire of the German ships. Their shells struck the British battleship one by one. HMS Prince of Wales, which had joined the fleet a few weeks earlier, found herself in the thick of the action. She hadn't finished the battle training cycle, and some of her guns and systems broke down from time to time. Eventually, the distance between the opponents was short enough to use secondary battery guns and the Germans were about to attack the target with torpedoes. The Prince of Wales Commander gave the order to use smoke and turn away, as only two main battery guns were operational and the risk of losing the ship was very high. Only then, HMS Suffolk reached the battlefield and was able to fire a few salvos in the direction of the German flagship.","IDS_PCQM044_DESCR":"The naval battle on May 24 ended with a convincing victory for the German fleet. Though, Bismarck was seriously damaged. A number of compartments were flooded, the ship speed was decreased, the catapult was broken, and the steaming distance was significantly decreased due to damaged fuel tanks. This condition didn't allow for further raiding on ocean communications, and the battleship Commander decided to set a course for a port in occupied France. Covering the cruiser Prinz Eugen breaking to the Atlantic, on the evening of May 24, Bismarck engaged her pursuers – the battleship Prince of Wales, cruisers Norfolk and Suffolk. As a result, the British forces let Prinz Eugen slip by. Meanwhile, after receiving the news about the battlecruiser Hood wreckage, the Home Fleet commanders decided to concentrate on intercepting the raiders of all forces: about fifty ships, including two aircraft carriers and a few battleships. Overnight, into May 25, Bismarck was attacked by aircraft from the aircraft carrier Victorious and was hit by a torpedo. The damage to the ship became more extensive.","IDS_PCQM045_DESCR":"On the dawn on May 25, Bismarck managed to outmaneuver the enemy ships, left the British radar coverage area, and set a course for France. Britain's forces started searching for the battleship, using reconnaissance planes from the shore bases and aircraft carriers. Despite all their efforts, they didn't find any signs of Bismarck as it moved toward the base for more than a day. Only on the morning of May 26, a flying boat Consolidated PBY Catalina spotted the battleship. The main forces of the Home Fleet were far behind. Only Force H, which started its pursuit three days earlier, could intercept the raider. The cruiser HMS Sheffield, which detected the location of the German battleship, passed the coordinates to the torpedo bombers from the aircraft carrier Ark Royal. One of the three torpedoes that hit Bismarck disabled her steering gear and thus determined the ship's fate.","IDS_PCQM046_DESCR":"As darkness fell on May 26, Bismarck, with her damaged steering gear, managed to hit the cruiser HMS Sheffield with a few salvos, and forced her to retreat hurriedly. However, Captain Vian's group of destroyers arrived on the battlefield. One of them, the Polish destroyer ORP Piorun that first detected the enemy, engaged her alone. Several salvos from the 380 mm guns forced the heroic destroyer to retreat. Meanwhile, Captain Vian's group of destroyers surrounded Bismarck and tried to hit her with torpedoes. Throughout the night of May 26–27, destroyers Cossack, Sikh, Maori and, Zulu attacked the damaged battleship several times. Bismarck was barely avoiding torpedoes while firing back with all guns. Darkness and turbulent waters played into the German's hands and allowed them to avoid any further damage.","IDS_PCQM047_DESCR":"Captain Vian's destroyers fulfilled their task. They exhausted the crew on the German battleship and directed the main forces of the Home Fleet to the target. On the morning of May 27, Bismarck was spotted by the battleships King George V and Rodney. Salvos from the Germans were accurate, but the British were more so. They quickly disabled the forward guns on the German battleship and destroyed the main fire control director. Eventually, two heavy British cruisers joined the battle. In addition to their main battery guns, the British opened fire with their dual-purpose guns and torpedoes. One torpedo from Rodney struck Bismarck. Once all German guns were put out of action, the British battleships started firing at Bismarck at close range. Torpedo bombers that flied off the aircraft carrier Ark Royal for a new attack held back, as the battle outcome was already decided. Finally, the cruiser Dorsetshire sank the unlucky raider with a pair of torpedoes.","IDS_PCQM051_DESCR":"The future naval commander was born in a samurai family. The self-discipline and warrior spirit of Takano Isoroku, who became famous after taking the Yamamoto surname, were nurtured in the Spartan conditions of the Imperial Naval Academy in Etajima.

Cruiser Nisshin, with Isoroku on board, spent many hours confronting armadillos and cruisers of one of the major powers together with the Japanese battleships and suffered the greatest damages. Fragments of exploded main turrets seriously hurt Takano Isoroku, but he didn't leave his post until the combat ended. The courage of the young officer was noticed by Admiral Tōgō, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet.","IDS_PCQM052_DESCR":"After winning the war against Russia, Japan became one of the naval powers.

He was appointed a head of the first Japanese naval aviation school where new aircraft for the Navy were tested.","IDS_PCQM053_DESCR":"In the late 1920s, Yamamoto was appointed Commander of Akagi, the most powerful aircraft carrier of the Japanese Navy. Due to his extensive knowledge, he participated as Rear and Vice Admiral in two international naval conferences to protect the interests of his country. For a while, Yamamoto commanded the First Carrier Division, then, for a few years, he managed key units of the Navy Ministry, which were responsible for carrier-based aircraft development, and initiated the development of several promising aircraft models. In 1939, Yamamoto left his post of Deputy Navy Minister to become Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, the largest naval force of Japan. Though he was against the aggressive intentions of the Army command, which gained a major influence in the country, the Admiral had to prepare the fleet for its upcoming confrontation with the U.S.A. on the Pacific Ocean. Under his command, a famous tactic of the Japanese Navy was honed: attack the enemy at night using the firepower of cruiser squadrons and destroyer-launched torpedoes.","IDS_PCQM054_DESCR":"Admiral Yamamoto was one of the commanders who foresaw the crucial role of aircraft carriers in the imminent naval hostilities. Though, opposing the necessity of building super battleships, he believed that battleships were the pillars of any naval power. The idea that general engagement of the battle fleet was the only way to gain victory on the ocean battlefront was very popular among the Japanese Navy Commanders after the Battle of Tsushima. Yamamoto, who learned much about the U.S.A. during his service, understood that Japan had a chance to defeat this industrial giant by utilizing surprise air strikes on the U.S.A. ships. That is how the idea to attack Pearl Harbor, the main naval base of the Pacific Fleet, appeared. This attack brilliantly planned by Yamamoto and performed by his pet project, the First Carrier Division, went down in history. The Japanese torpedo bombers and bombers achieved impressive results and repeated the success of Admiral Tōgō: seven battleships were disabled, some of them for good.","IDS_PCQM055_DESCR":"After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Admiral Yamamoto commanded a series of brilliant naval operations and took control of vast territories in the Pacific region. He provided guidance from the most massive Japanese battleships: Nagato, Yamato, and Musashi. His thoroughly planned landing operations included victorious naval battles, in which the forces of the U.S.A., U.K., Australia, and Netherlands were utterly smashed. Progressive tactics and effective use of torpedoes were the strengths of Yamamoto's fleet. Cruiser divisions and destroyer flotillas paved the way, aircraft carriers were the main striking force, and battleships waited for a general engagement. However, Yamamoto's concerns that people, warship, and aircraft losses after a confrontation with the U.S.A. couldn't be compensated, had been justified. The victories were followed by defeats: Midway, Guadalcanal, and many others. In April 1943, Admiral Yamamoto was inspecting the key points on the long frontline. U.S.A. surveillance deciphered information about the flights of the Commander-in-Chief. They organized an extensive operation to intercept the aircraft with Yamamoto on board and managed to shoot it down over the jungles of an island in the Pacific Ocean. The prominent Admiral died clutching his samurai sword.","IDS_PCQM056_DESCR":"This operation, aimed at disrupting the Allied supply chain destined for the U.S.S.R through the Arctic waters by destroying one of the convoys, was given the title \\\"Ostfront\\\" (in German, \\\"The Eastern Front\\\") for a reason. On December 22, 1943, the Germans detected a group of transport ships sailing along the Norwegian coast. After a long period of hesitation and reconnaissance, the British escorting squadron was never found, so the Kriegsmarine Command decided to take a chance. On the night of December 25, 1943, the battleship Scharnhorst set sail, escorted by the 4th Destroyer Flotilla (flotilla leader: Z-29). The combination of the freezing polar night, a violent storm, mistakes made by German admirals and excellent British radars meant that Scharnhorst, who had by that time \\\"lost\\\" her destroyers, encountered the British squadron (consisting of three cruisers led by HMS Belfast) alone. The first salvos fired by the British took the Germans totally by surprise. Shells fired from HMS Norfolk destroyed the battleship's main radar, but Scharnhorst had no intention of engaging the cruisers, and evaded the pursuit by taking advantage of her superior speed in stormy weather to continue her hunt for the convoy.","IDS_PCQM057_DESCR":"Vice Admiral Burnett's squadron of British cruisers continued in their duty of defending the transport ships while Scharnhorst spent several hours searching for the convoy, largely in vain. A flotilla of destroyers, comprised of HMS Matchless, HMS Musketeer, HMS Opportune and HMS Virago, joined forces with Burnett's fleet. Meanwhile, British admirals were becoming increasingly concerned that the battleship had managed to slip through their fingers. However, in the Arctic night and with a crippled radar, Scharnhorst was effectively blind, while the radar equipment aboard the British fleet remained fully operational. At around midday on December 26, HMS Belfast picked up Scharnhorst on radar once again. A fierce battle ensued with the German battleship hitting back hard. The British had a rough time of it: 283 mm shells from Scharnhorst disabled one of HMS Norfolk's main battery turrets, inflicting extensive damage on the ship's hull; HMS Sheffield was riddled with shrapnel and destroyer Virago was nearly sunk by the battleship's main battery salvo.","IDS_PCQM058_DESCR":"Although unaware of it, the next time Scharnhorst encountered the convoy, she was a mere 12 to 15 miles away. But Rear Admiral Bey, who flew his flag on the battleship, decided to abandon the operation, sending Scharnhorst and the destroyers that were desperately searching for their prey towards the Norwegian coast. Burnett's fleet continued to pursue Scharnhorst at maximum speed, keeping her in the sights of the radar while remaining beyond the battleship's line-of-sight. The damaged British cruisers struggled through the severe storm and eventually had to drop back, one-by-one, until HMS Belfast was left alone in her pursuit of Scharnhorst. The British ship continuously transmitted the whereabouts of Scharnhorst to the forces of Admiral Fraser, who was hurrying to the rendezvous point. The German destroyers, led by the Z-29, were too far away to be of any assistance or serve as their flagship's \\\"eyes\\\". Meanwhile, Scharnhorst, with disabled radar, was heading straight into the trap—the battleship Duke of York, the cruiser Jamaica and four destroyers (HMS Savage, HMS Saumarez, HMS Scorpion and Norwegian destroyer Stord) which were steaming at full speed to intercept the German \\\"predator\\\". The British Flag Officer, Vice Admiral Fraser, gave the order to open fire as late as possible, surprising the enemy ship at the shortest possible distance. Finally, at 16:47, the blindsided German battleship was illuminated by a volley of British star shells, and the Duke of York immediately began the bombardment with a salvo from all ten of her 356 mm guns... The fire coming from the British ships was surprisingly accurate—one of the first hits on Scharnhorst wrecked her main battery tower.","IDS_PCQM059_DESCR":"Trapped, Scharnhorst immediately set on a course to shake off the enemy ships, steaming at full speed and returning fire in defense. At this point, the British cruisers joined the battle: Belfast, and later Norfolk, were closing in from the North and Jamaica from the South. Scharnhorst found herself in a dire situation. Duke of York fired a deluge of shells at the enemy ship, scoring hit after hit, knocking down artillery and destroying the ship's superstructures. Nevertheless, the thick armor belt of the German battleship protected her from critical damage, and Scharnhorst, steaming at a speed of over 30 knots, was gradually breaking away from the British ships, reaching a point where she was beyond the reach of the enemy cruisers. Soon after, the British flagship ceased fire, too. However, shortly before that, a 356 mm shell fired by Duke of York pierced the thin upper armor belt of the German battleship and exploded in the boiler room. Scharnhorst's speed dropped, and with this critical hit the ship's fortunes took a dramatic turn for the worse.","IDS_PCQM060_DESCR":"The British ships were approaching the heavily damaged, yet still formidable, German battleship. Admiral Fraser ordered the destroyers to mount a torpedo attack. Savage, Saumarez, Scorpion and Stord pressed ahead, closing in on the target and, despite counterfire, launched 28 torpedoes scoring four hits. Despite the damage, Scharnhorst demonstrated excellent survivability, maneuvering and firing her remaining guns. HMS Duke of York closed in again and fired at the German battleship. Scharnhorst lost all control of her steering and almost ground to a halt. Cruisers Belfast, Jamaica and the remaining destroyers dashed forward to finish the enemy ship off. HMS Musketeer fired her four torpedoes at the desperate Scharnhorst from a distance of several hundred meters. The German battleship sustained a total of at least 11 hits. At around 19:45, Scharnhorst disappeared under the waves amid clouds of smoke and fire.\\n\\nThe British sailors were astounded by the enemy's resilience in combat. After the battle ceased, Admiral Fraser said \\\"I hope that if any of you are ever called upon to lead a ship into action against an opponent many times superior, you will command your ship as gallantly as Scharnhorst was commanded today.\\\"","IDS_PCQM070_DESCR":"William Frederick Halsey Jr. was a natural-born seaman. He was born in the small port town of Elizabeth, New Jersey, to the family of naval officer. The future Admiral's ancestry included many pirates and whalers, so he was destined to spend his life at sea. In 1899, after failing to obtain a long-awaited appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Halsey Jr. entered the University of Virginia with the single purpose to join the Navy, even as a physician. The only great thing he acquired at university was his passion for American football.\\n\\nWhen Halsey eventually joined the Naval Academy in 1900, little did they know they had opened its doors to one of its most famous graduates. However, capricious and stubborn \\\"Pudge\\\" Halsey was not the sharpest tool in the shed. As far as his academic performance was concerned, he ranked 42nd out of 62 students of the class of 1904. The first ship in his naval career was battleship Missouri. The symbolism of this assignment would only become apparent 40 years later.","IDS_PCQM071_DESCR":"Commissioned to his first officer rank in 1906, Halsey participated in a legendary cruise of the Great White Fleet—a 1907–1909 round-the-world voyage of the 16 advanced U.S. battleships, which was meant to demonstrate the increased naval power of the U.S.A.—aboard battleship Kansas. During the visit to Japan, Halsey had a chance to come aboard Mikasa, the renowned flagship of the Japanese Combined Fleet. This glorified battleship didn't impress Halsey... After the cruise ended, the young officer left the ships with big guns for service aboard smaller, faster destroyers.\\n\\nDuring World War I, Halsey was eventually assigned as a ship commander. The ship was USS Shaw, the Sampson-class destroyer. Once he happened to command a division consisting of two American destroyers and two British sloops, of which he would later recall that he was as \\\"proud as a dog with two tails\\\". By the end of the war, Halsey was decorated with a Navy Cross.","IDS_PCQM072_DESCR":"In the early 1920s, Halsey, who hardly ever disembarked from a ship during his service, was suddenly appointed as a U.S. naval attaché in Germany and Scandinavia. In 1930, he commanded a division of destroyers. Then, to pave the way to the rank of admiral, Halsey studied at the U.S. Naval War College for senior officers. In 1935, he was assigned as commander of USS Saratoga, one of the most powerful U.S. Navy aircraft carriers of that time. However, this position required completion of an air observer course. Halsey didn't like this perspective, as he thought it would be much better to control the airplane himself rather than being the \\\"second person in the cockpit\\\".\\n\\nIn 1935, the 52-years-old Halsey completed the full course of a naval pilot, and became the oldest man in the history of the U.S. Navy to earn the Naval Aviator's Wings. Being one of the few at that time, Halsey, same as his future opponent Yamamoto Isoroku, became a big advocate for naval aviation, foreseeing that aircraft carriers will be the greatest power in the future war in the ocean.","IDS_PCQM073_DESCR":"On the day of the Pearl Harbor attack, Vice Admiral Halsey, who was in charge of the task force headed by USS Enterprise, was far from the Hawaii base, as the storm had delayed their arrival. After learning of the Japanese attack, the admiral, who had an explosive temper, let the hatred for the new enemy grow in his heart. Chester W. Nimitz, the newly appointed commander-in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, realized that Halsey's aggression and restlessness was just the right thing for the American seamen depressed by the Pearl Harbor disaster. For this reason, in early 1942, it was Halsey who, with the help of his carrier task force, held a series of lightning-like \\\"hit-and-run\\\" raids on the Japanese strongholds. After James Doolittle's bombers took off for the Tokyo Raid from the deck of Halsey's aircraft carriers, the name of William Halsey became a personification of the belief in victory over Japan for every American.\\n\\nIn October of 1942, after taking the command over the South Pacific forces, Halsey led the persistent fight for Guadalcanal, one of the Solomon Islands, that was a key to the entire Pacific Campaign.","IDS_PCQM074_DESCR":"During the Battle of Guadalcanal, Halsey turned out to be the one the U.S.A. needed the most at that place and time. He fueled confidence in all his subordinates, including each and every seaman or marine, with his overflowing energy and belligerence. He struck blow after blow to the Japanese by sending the advanced battleships and aircraft carriers to the narrow straits of the Solomon Islands, when he thought it was worth it.\\n\\nWhen, in February 1943, the Americans gained total control over Guadalcanal, Halsey continued the struggle for the remaining islands of the archipelago. He was the first commander in the Pacific theater to apply the strategy of \\\"island-hopping\\\" over the most reinforced defensive strong points of the Japanese. \\\"As long as I have one plane and one pilot I will stay on the offensive.\\\" Step-by-step the Admiral was pushing forward, taking risks, making mistakes, and suffering losses, not always justified. The culmination point of the fleet commander's career happened on September 2, 1945. On that day, the surrender of the Japanese Empire was signed aboard USS Missouri, the flagship of Admiral Halsey, who was the commander of the Third Fleet, the most powerful task force in the U.S. Navy.","IDS_PCQM075_DESCR":"Imperial Japanese Navy destroyer Hatsuharu (Japanese for \\\"Early Spring\\\"), the leader of a series of six ships, was commissioned on September 30, 1933, and laid down at the Naval Arsenal shipyard in the city of Sasebo in May, 1931. Her service record during World War II included the invasion of the Dutch East Indies, activities off the Aleutian Islands, and the Battle of Leyte Gulf, amongst other operations. The destroyer sank on November 13, 1944, after being bombed by American aircraft during her breakthrough from Manila Bay.","IDS_PCQM076_DESCR":"The Kriegsmarine's light cruiser Nürnberg, named after the ship sunk during World War I, was laid down in December 1933 in the city of Kiel. In early 1936, some time after being commissioned, she became the flagship of the German Naval Intelligence Service. During World War II, she took part in operations in the North Sea, as well as in Norwegian waters and the Baltic. After the war, she was handed over to the Soviet Navy and renamed Admiral Makarov.","IDS_PCQM077_DESCR":"Royal Navy destroyer Icarus, named after a character from ancient Greek mythology, was laid down in March 1936, in Clydebank, Scotland. The operational record of the ship during World War II was one of the most intense amongst all British destroyers. Icarus took part in numerous convoy operations in the Atlantic, Arctic, and Mediterranean, in combat operations in Norwegian waters, and in the Dunkirk evacuation and Normandy landings. The war veteran was removed from the fleet lists in 1946.","IDS_PCQM078_DESCR":"Light cruiser Dallas was modeled in World of Warships based on Project 389, developed by the Bureau of Construction and Repair of the U.S. Navy in late 1934. The new ship inherited many elements of the Brooklyn-class cruisers that were being prepared for laying down at the time, but had a lower displacement due to restrictions imposed by the 1930 London Maritime Conference. Eventually, U.S. Navy Command abandoned the idea of building a small cruiser and, having found a loophole in the contract, built two 10,000-ton ships instead – USS Helena and USS St. Louis – the full-fledged products of the evolution of the Brooklyn class.","IDS_PCQM079_DESCR":"French Navy battleship Normandie, named after the province in the north of France, was laid down on April 18, 1913, at a shipyard in the city of Saint-Nazaire. The unique feature of having four-gun main turrets was supposed to be the highlight of this super dreadnought. The ship's hull was put afloat in October 1914, but World War I, which was gaining momentum at the time, prevented the continuation of her construction. After the war was over, French Navy Command considered various options for completing the Normandie-class battleships, including potential modernization that would take their recent battle experience into account, but they eventually abandoned this idea at the end of 1919.","IDS_PCQM080_DESCR":"Mackensen-class battlecruisers, Prinz Eitel Friedrich being one of them, were giant monsters indeed, weighing in at 31,000 tons. Capable of speeds up to 28 knots, and wielding 300 mm-thick armor, their main armament was intended to consist of eight specially designed 350 mm guns with ammunition weighing 600 kg. At the time when all four ships of the series were being laid down in 1915, there was no country in the world with such powerful and fast ships.","IDS_PCQM081_DESCR":"Prior to World War I, the Russian Empire had been rapidly developing its fleet. By the time war broke out, seven battleships were finished and already afloat, preparing for commissioning trials. Shipyards were busy day and night, building the hulls for one battleship (to become Imperator Nikolai I) and four Izmail-class battlecruisers. The latter had an exceptionally striking presence: 32,000 tons of displacement, 222 meters in length, a speed of up to 27 knots, and twelve 356 mm guns. In the midst of the war, despite reduced funding and missed deadlines for the manufacture of some mechanisms, all five ships were still put afloat, but the Russian Revolution prevented them from being completed. In the 1920s, the hulls of the former Imperator and all Izmails were finally scrapped for metal.","IDS_PCQM082_DESCR":"The Marine Nationale (the French Navy) also had extensive construction plans in the early 20th century. In the summer of 1914, three Bretagne-class battleships were at the final stage of completion, and five Normandie-class battleships were still in the shipyards. Four Lyon-class battleships, with unprecedented armament of sixteen 340 mm guns, were supposed to be laid down the following year. Combined with the Courbet-class ships already in service, France would have had a formidable battle fleet, consisting of sixteen ships. But the outbreak of war dissolved these dreams. The entirety of the country's resources were redirected to the needs of the army, which retained a huge land front with its exhausting and violent battles. The Bretagne-class battleships were eventually put into operation, but Normandie-class ships had a much sadder fate – after the war, the hulls of four of them were scrapped for metal, while the fifth was finished as an aircraft carrier. The Lyon-class battleships weren't even laid down.","IDS_PCQM083_DESCR":"For the U.K., their fleet was not just a matter of pride, it was the nation's main weapon during World War I. Hence, no effort was spared to make it stronger. During the war, the U.K. launched more than a dozen battleships and cruisers. At the time of the end of the war in November 1918, another four monstrous ships were at various stages of construction. These were Hood-class battlecruisers with a displacement of over 42,000 tons and a length of 262 meters. Four years of war would eventually exhaust the resources of even an empire as large as Britain's, but Naval Command decided to finish the lead ship anyway. HMS Hood entered service in 1920, becoming a symbol of the Royal Navy's strength for two decades. As for her three sister ships, their story ended before it had even begun, with the steel of their hulls repurposed for peacetime needs.","IDS_PCQM084_DESCR":"The beginning of the 20th century was the German Navy's heyday, with their fleet comprising hundreds of warships, including nearly two dozen dreadnought battleships. In the coming war, the Kaiserliche Marine would face the world's largest fleet – the Royal British Navy. The large-scale construction of capital ships continued in the German Empire throughout World War I. At the time the truce was signed (November 1918), two more Bayern-class battleships and four Mackensen-class battlecruisers were at different stages of readiness. Three more battlecruisers with 33,500 ton displacement and 380 mm artillery were ordered, but their construction never actually began. The Versailles Peace Treaty of 1919 turned these failed rulers of the seas into vast piles of scrap metal.","IDS_PCQM085_DESCR":"The fact that the United States entered World War I somewhat late, and Japan was situated far from the main military events of the war, meant that neither nation suffered from the same level of material exhaustion as the other participants of the conflict. After 1918, these two powers didn't even consider curtailing their shipbuilding programs – in fact they enhanced them. Between 1920 and 21, two Kaga-class battleships and four Amagi-class battlecruisers were laid down in Japan, with four Kii-class battleships also on order. Concurrently, six South Dakota-class battleships and six Lexington-class battlecruisers were laid down in the USA. Both Japanese and American ships were to carry guns with a caliber exceeding 400 mm and have a displacement of 40,000 tons or more. However, the signing of an international treaty on the limitation of naval weapons in Washington in 1922 prevented this enormous steel armada from being commissioned. Most of the ships were sent for scrap, and only four were completed, but as aircraft carriers.

This region of Poland was part of the Russian Empire at the time, and the future admiral's father had served as a field officer in the Russian army. At first, the young man followed in his father's footsteps and graduated from the 1st Moscow Cadet Corps, but in 1899, he chose a different career path.\\n\\nŚwirski passed the necessary exams to be enrolled in the senior classes of the Naval Cadet Corps in St. Petersburg—the sole educational institution for training combat officers for the Russian Imperial Navy. Three years later, he received the rank of midshipman and was appointed to the newest light cruiser, Askold. Once on board, he departed for the Far East. But the young officer did not take part in the Russo-Japanese War—in 1903, he caught a serious lung disease, returned to St. Petersburg, and spent the next two years recovering.\\n\\nJerzy continued his service in the Black Sea Fleet, and in 1905, was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. He completed navigation courses and gradually climbed the ranks, acting as a navigation officer on cruisers, then battleships, then as a navigational flag officer for the navigation section of the destroyer division and battleship brigade. In 1912, Świrski received the rank of senior lieutenant, and just before the outbreak of World War I, he was appointed as chief of navigation branch in the headquarters of the commander of the Black Sea Fleet.\\n\\nJerzy held this crucial position throughout the war and even beyond, until May 1918. Together with the fleet commanders of the World War I period—Admirals A.A. Eberhard and A.V. Kolchak—Świrski participated in military campaigns and was involved in clashes with German-Turkish forces on the Black Sea. By October 1917, he had received three military orders of the Russian Empire and the rank of naval commander. However, Jerzy Świrski wasn't destined to become an admiral of the Russian Navy.","IDS_PCQM087_SWIRSKI_DESCR":"At the end of 1917, the empire for which Świrski had served as a commander ceased to exist. In Eastern Europe, World War I ended in May 1918, and German troops had occupied Crimea, with German flags hoisted over the ships moored in Sevastopol.\\n\\nLike the majority of Black Sea naval officers in the spring of 1918, Świrski was left on the sidelines, with no means to support himself and in territory occupied by the former enemy. The Bolsheviks were not highly regarded by officers of Polish descent. The solution came with the proclamation of the Ukrainian state, headed by Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi. Many retired officers were eager to join the former general of the Russian Imperial Army, Świrski being one of them. In June of the same year, he joined the Ukrainian Navy.\\n\\nAs an experienced officer, he was appointed to the naval headquarters in Kiev. In September, a state delegation was sent to Berlin to ensure the transfer of warships from the Germans. The delegation included commander Świrski. In mid-October, he very briefly served as deputy minister of naval affairs but resigned soon after.\\n\\nThe central powers had lost the war over the territories of the crumbling empire that the Rzeczpospolita had been reviving, so as a Pole, there was nothing more for Jerzy Świrski to do in the service of the Ukrainian state.\\n\\nUntil the spring of 1919, the former commander was in Odessa—a city occupied by the Entente—at the disposal of the Main Polish Military Committee in the East. Świrski headed the League for the Renewal of the Polish Navy, which was gathering and sending seamen of Polish descent to their homeland. In March, the commander of the Polish army in France, Józef Haller, summoned him to Paris as a maritime affairs expert for the Polish delegation at the Congress of Versailles.

As such, he became fully responsible for all aspects of the development of the Polish naval forces during the interwar period. Constant financial deficiencies and continuous changes in the views of the role of the fleet held by the military and political leadership of the country made this no easy task.\\n\\nHowever, Świrski, who was promoted to the rank of rear admiral in 1931, was able to maintain the relative independence of the navy within the armed forces, create a professional naval officer corps, and put many useful measures for the crews' combat training into practice. He was also the one to sign off the contracts for the construction of new warships for the small Polish Navy. The rear admiral spared no efforts in the development of the naval base in the new port city of Gdynia, created in the mid-1920s on the country's 90-mile Baltic coast, in order to construct a coastal defense system on the Hel Peninsula.\\n\\nIn 1936, Jerzy Świrski was awarded the Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta for outstanding services.\\n\\nDue to the rapid deterioration of the political situation in Europe in the first half of 1939, the command of the Polish Navy—headed by Świrski—carefully examined various potential scenarios for the hostilities and the available options for the navy in those situations. The conclusions of the experienced officer were alarming: since the British and French were refusing to send their ships to the Baltic in the event of a new world war, the Polish fleet would be doomed and quickly destroyed—a force of enemy aircraft could achieve this on its own. Moreover, the Polish Armed Forces held the opinion that the sole task of the navy was to engage in battle with the overwhelming forces of the enemy and perish heroically.\\n\\nIt was only thanks to the efforts, perseverance and reputation of Rear Admiral Świrski that the authorities agreed on the anticipatory withdrawal of the modern Polish destroyers from the Baltic Sea in the event of war's inevitability. According to the plan, they were to operate on the German sea routes from English ports. In the last days of August 1939, it became explicitly clear that the Germans were ready for their assault. On August 30, a division consisting of destroyers Błyskawica, Grom and Burza received the order to start their journey to the U.K. While giving this order from Warsaw, the chief of the directorate of the Polish Navy had no idea under what circumstances he would next see these ships.","IDS_PCQM089_SWIRSKI_DESCR":"As a result of a quick campaign in 1939, the Polish Navy, which had been defending the nation's coast, was cut off from the rest of the country within just a few hours. But the defenders of the coastal fortifications, built before the war under the leadership of Jerzy Świrski, were among those who managed to hold off the enemy's attack for the longest time in Poland. These were sailors and soldiers under the command of Commander-in-Chief Józef Unrug, who succeeded in holding the line on the Hel Peninsula until October 1.\\n\\nŚwirski himself, together with the Polish Ministry of Military Affairs, followed the evacuation orders—first leaving Warsaw and then heading southeast. In late September, he crossed the Romanian border.\\n\\nHowever, in the early days of October 1939, the rear admiral was summoned to Paris by the head of the new Polish government-in-exile by General Władysław Sikorski, and was appointed as chief of the reconstituted Directorate of the Polish Navy. Fluent in foreign languages, and with rich experience in interacting with representatives of the Allied navies during the interwar period, Jerzy Świrski played a crucial role in bringing about the conclusion of the Polish-British naval agreement in November 1939. It enabled the warships of the defeated state to continue to play their part in the war at sea, embedded within the British Royal Navy.\\n\\nThanks to the efforts of the rear admiral, the Polish ships retained their national distinctions, naval flag, and order of service. Świrski was responsible for recruitment and training, as well as personnel and disciplinary decisions, and he did a great deal to expand the naval presence of the Polish Navy in the West.\\n\\nHaving received the rank of vice admiral in 1941, the chief of the Directorate of the Navy acted so independently in relation to Sikorski, chief of staff of the Polish forces in the West, that the latter even made an attempt to stand Świrski down. However, the British Admiralty was strongly against such a decision, with no clear option for someone who could replace him as the actual commander of the Polish Navy. For his merits during the war, His Majesty's government rewarded Jerzy Świrski with the Order of the Bath.\\n\\nAs a result, he remained in this post until the end of World War II and left the service only in 1946, after the official dissolution of the Polish armed forces in the U.K. The vice admiral remained there as an emigrant, having decided not to return to Soviet Poland.\\n\\nJerzy Włodzimierz Świrski lived in London and was the beneficiary of a life-long pension from the Admiralty.

Two more ships of this class were ordered in Poland but were never laid down because of the war. The other two destroyers were Wicher and Burza (built in France and based on the design of the Bourrasque-class destroyers in 1930 and 1932), which were intended to be overhauled in the early 1940s, with their weaponry to be replaced with armament similar to that of Błyskawica.\\n\\nMinelayer Gryf, built in 1938 in France, was supposed to fulfill the additional functions of a training ship and ceremonial presidential yacht. Finally, the largest ships to be built in Poland were six Jaskółka-class minesweepers.\\n\\nThey had a total of five submarines, the most up to date of which were the large ocean-going submarines, Orzeł and Sęp, which had been specially designed and built in the Netherlands before being commissioned into the fleet in the spring of 1939.

Three mine-laying submarines—Żbik, Ryś, and Wilk—were also built in France between 1931 and 1932.\\n\\nAs a result of the September 1939 campaign, only five ships of the Polish Navy made it to the United Kingdom to continue the fight. However, of these, destroyer Grom and submarine Orzeł were sunk in 1940, while submarine Wilk was suitable only for training. The remaining destroyers, Burza and Błyskawica, fought for pride and glory. They eventually returned home and became museum ships, Burza first, from 1960–75, then Błyskawica after her.\\n\\nIn 1940, the Polish Navy was replenished with a British G-class destroyer, Garland, which retained her name, and an N-class destroyer named Piorun. In May 1941, the latter made her mark on history with a dashing night attack on battleship Bismarck. Both ships, like the other British ships, were returned to the U.K. in 1946. A different fate, however, awaited another British ship that hoisted the white-red flag in 1942—an M-class destroyer named Orkan. She was sunk by a German submarine in October 1943, while escorting a convoy in the North Atlantic. Three Hunt-class escort destroyers that were transferred to the Poles between 1941 and 1942—Krakowiak, Kujawiak, and Ślązak—also fulfilled escort duties. Thousands of nautical miles flowed under their sterns as they escorted hundreds of convoys. Kujawiak was destroyed by a mine near Malta in 1942.\\n\\nThe ships that served the Poles least of all were the largest ones—cruisers Dragon and Conrad. The former, a Danae-class British light cruiser, was handed over in January 1943. She was later badly damaged by a German manned torpedo in July 1944 off the coast of Normandy. She was not sent for repairs, and the Admiralty simply sent a replacement—another ship of the same class. As for the submarine fleet, British U-class submarines Sokół and Dzik, as well as an American S-class lend-lease submarine—Jastrząb—which was sunk in 1942, sailed under the Polish flag.","IDS_PCQT001_1":"Cause %(count)d HP of damage to enemy ships with the main battery guns.","IDS_PCQT004_1":"Cause %(count)d HP of damage to enemy ships with ship

It was made of silver with its obverse side depicting the imperial throne surrounded by clouds—a symbol of luck—and encircled by blossoms of cherry and mandarin trees.\\n\\nIn November 1928, shortly after returning from the U.S.A. where he'd served as a naval attaché for several years, Yamamoto Isoroku, at the rank of Captain, was put in command of the light cruiser Isuzu. Over time, the talented naval commander won the favor and support of the Emperor who appreciated Yamamoto's professional competence and strong commitment to his cause.","IDS_PCZC075_YAMAMOTO_NISSHIN":"Armored Cruiser Nisshin","IDS_PCZC075_YAMAMOTO_NISSHIN_DESCRIPTION":"Built in Italy, Nisshin was one of the renowned Garibaldi-class armored cruisers, which served in four navies around the world. Laid down by the order of Argentine, this cruiser was put on sale shortly before the conflict in the Far East and offered to Russia, but after the Russian government declined to purchase it, Japan stepped in and quickly bought the Nisshin-to-be cruiser. Capable of running at speeds of up to 20 knots, the ship was protected by a 152 mm armor belt, and carried four 203 mm main guns and fourteen 152 mm guns.\\n\\nHastily, the still-incomplete cruiser, together with her sister ship, was transferred to Japan. It arrived in February of 1904, during the very first days of the Russo-Japanese War. Two months later, Nisshin participated in combat actions. In January 1905, Takano Isoroku, a young Naval Academy graduate, was assigned to Nisshin to serve as an artillery officer. Later in May that year, the Battle of Tsushima became the first real challenge for the future naval commander.","IDS_PCZC076_YAMAMOTO_SOYA":"Protected Cruiser Soya","IDS_PCZC076_YAMAMOTO_SOYA_DESCRIPTION":"Formerly the Russian cruiser Varyag, scuttled by the crew during the battle against the Japanese squadron under command of Admiral Uryū in February 1904, this cruiser was refloated by the Japanese and renamed Soya. Following a long overhaul and upgrade, the ship was commissioned by the Japanese Navy in 1907. The ship's displacement was 6,500 tons, the upgraded propulsion let the ship run at a speed of 22.7 knots. The cruiser carried 12 Russian 152 mm guns and English 76 mm guns.\\n\\nSoya belonged to a training squadron aimed at practical training of future naval officers of the Imperial Navy. Lieutenant Takano served as a training officer on several ships of that squadron from June 1908 till July 1910, first on cruiser Aso (formely Russian Bayan), then on cruiser Soya starting from July 1909. During this period, he happened to participate in the large-scale fleet maneuvers and two long-term foreign voyages when he visited ports in North America, Australia, and Southeast Asia.","IDS_PCZC077_YAMAMOTO_KITAKAMI":"Light Cruiser Kitakami","IDS_PCZC077_YAMAMOTO_KITAKAMI_DESCRIPTION":"Japan developed the Kuma-class light cruisers at the end of World War I to counter the Omaha-class cruisers built by the U.S.A. Kitakami was the fourth ship in the series. When commissioned, the ship had a displacement of 5,500 tons, and a speed of more than 35 knots. The ship's primary armament consisted of seven 140 mm guns and four 533 mm twin torpedo tubes.\\n\\nUpon returning from the U.S.A. where he was a military attaché, in August 1921, Commander Yamamoto was assigned to the recently commissioned light cruiser Kitakami as a senior officer. This talented officer's career quickly progressed, not allowing him to stay in the same position for a long time. And thus in December 1921, just four months later, Yamamoto was appointed an instructor at the Naval War College that he had graduated from a couple of years before.","IDS_PCZC078_YAMAMOTO_AKAGI":"Aircraft Carrier Akagi","IDS_PCZC078_YAMAMOTO_AKAGI_DESCRIPTION":"Initially laid down as a battlecruiser, this ship was completed as an aircraft carrier in order to meet the requirements of the Washington Naval Treaty, which imposed strict limitations on the number of new battleships. The aircraft carrier was commissioned in 1927. Prior to the 1935 upgrade, the ship's displacement was 27,000 tons, the speed was 31 knots, and the armor thickness was 152 mm. The air group consisted of 60 aircraft. In her first years of service, the ships artillery included ten 200 mm guns.\\n\\nAfter a short period commanding the light cruiser Isuzu, in December 1928, Yamamoto Isoroku was assigned to the aircraft carrier Akagi as her commander. At that moment Akagi was the largest ship of her type. Advocating strict discipline, Yamamoto managed to win the respect and affection of the whole crew.","IDS_PCZC079_YAMAMOTO_KAGA":"Aircraft Carrier Kaga","IDS_PCZC079_YAMAMOTO_KAGA_DESCRIPTION":"The Great Kantō earthquake caused the destruction of the battlecruiser Amagi that was supposed to be completed as an aircraft carrier. Instead, a decision was made to refit the unfinished battleship Kaga that was finally commissioned as an aircraft carrier in 1928. The ship could run at a speed of 28.5 knots, her air group consisted of 60 aircraft in the first years of service. Her artillery armament was as good as the artillery of heavy cruisers and consisted of ten 200 mm guns placed in turrets and casemates.\\n\\nIn October 1933, Rear Admiral Yamamoto was assigned as a commander of the First Carrier Division, whose most powerful ship at that moment was aircraft carrier Kaga. Gradually grasping all the subtle aspects of naval aviation, the new Commander vigorously took on training the ship crews of his unit trying to raise their combat skills to the highest level possible.","IDS_PCZC080_YAMAMOTO_NAGATO":"Battleship Nagato","IDS_PCZC080_YAMAMOTO_NAGATO_DESCRIPTION":"Nagato was developed during World War I according to the \\\"fast battleship\\\" concept. Eight 410 mm guns were supposed to constitute her primary armament in an attempt to respond to new powerful naval gun systems designed in Britain and the U.S.A. The battleship's main armor belt had a thickness of 300 mm. Nagato was commissioned in 1920, and in the mid 1930s, the ship underwent a major overhaul.\\n\\nVice Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku was appointed the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet just a day before the outbreak of World War II, on August 30, 1939. The new Commander-in-Chief hoisted his flag on Nagato, the most powerful ship of the Empire of Japan. Yamamoto was onboard Nagato when he gave his famous order to commence the attack on Pearl Harbor, whereupon he took his ship along with five more battleships to sea, providing remote cover for the First Air Fleet.","IDS_PCZC081_YAMAMOTO_YAMATO":"Battleship Yamato","IDS_PCZC081_YAMAMOTO_YAMATO_DESCRIPTION":"The legendary superbattleship was developed in the mid 1930s with an aim to surpass any battleships of potential rivals, primarily the U.S.A., that could be built within the ten following year. Yamato's construction was carried out in absolute secrecy. The battleship started her service in the first weeks of the Pacific War, in December 1941.\\n\\nIn February 1942, Admiral Yamamoto carried his flag over to Yamato, which was in the final phase of the re-equipment process. For a year, he commanded the Combined Fleet from the largest warship in the world. In late May 1942, a number of Japanese battleships led by Yamato took to the sea in order to provide support for the carrier battle group near Midway. Operation MI ended in the loss of four Japanese aircraft carriers, which marked the end of the victorious offensive of Japan in the Pacific Ocean. It was onboard Yamato that Admiral Yamamoto had to experience the grief of another defeat—the Guadalcanal Campaign—that depleted the Japanese Navy.","IDS_PCZC082_YAMAMOTO_MUSASHI":"Battleship Musashi","IDS_PCZC082_YAMAMOTO_MUSASHI_DESCRIPTION":"Yamato's sister ship was laid down in 1938, and commissioned in the summer of 1942. The ship displaced more than 63,000 tons of water, two thirds of which accounted for the weight of its armor protection alone. The battleship's main battery included the most powerful naval guns in the world, namely nine 460 mm guns. Yamamoto, who later flew his flag on both ships during his service at the Navy Ministry, was opposed to the idea of building extremely expensive giants such as Musashi and Yamato, considering such expenditure of resources unreasonable.\\n\\nIn February 1943, Musashi arrived at the main Japanese Navy base on Truk island. The brand new battleship was specifically equipped to serve as a flagship. Therefore, Yamamoto transferred his flag to Musashi immediately after her arrival. Several weeks later, the Admiral set out on the fateful trip to Rabaul. In May 1943, the ashes of the perished Yamamoto were brought to Japan onboard his final flagship, battleship Musashi.","IDS_PCZC083_YAMAMOTO_BUILDING":"Imperial Naval Academy Building on the Island of Etajima","IDS_PCZC083_YAMAMOTO_BUILDING_DESCRIPTION":"The Imperial Naval Academy was the principal educational establishment for training naval officers. It was founded in 1876 during the first years of Emperor Mutsuhito's reign, when massive reforms were initialized in Japan, and the country's naval force was formed. In 1888, the Imperial Naval Academy was moved to the island of Etajima situated in Hiroshima Bay, where a special building was constructed to accommodate it in 1893.\\n\\nAlmost without exception, officers of the Imperial Navy passed through the halls of this Academy. On Etajima, during three years of training in a severe and ascetic atmosphere, the samurai spirit of future combat commanders was tempered. Takano Isoroku, who would later become Admiral Yamamoto, studied at the Naval Academy from 1901 till 1904.","IDS_PCZC084_YAMAMOTO_NISSHIN_GUN":"Fore End Turret of Cruiser Nisshin After the Battle of Tsushima","IDS_PCZC084_YAMAMOTO_NISSHIN_GUN_DESCRIPTION":"During the Battle of Tsushima that was the decisive encounter between the Russian and Japanese navies in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, the armored cruiser Nisshin, where Takano Isoroku served at that time, was the junior flagship of the main battle force under command of Admiral Togo. As a result of the intensive maneuvering, at some point of the battle the cruiser got a chance to lead the entire squadron for some time. More than once Nisshin found herself under concentrated gun fire from Russian armored cruisers. Three of her four main battery guns were destroyed and about 100 crew members were lost or injured, which made her one of Japan's most battle-scarred ships. Takano Isoroku was also heavily injured in the explosion of the 203 mm gun of the fore end turret.","IDS_PCZC085_YAMAMOTO_MITSUBISHI_B1M":"Carrier Strike Aircraft Mitsubishi B1M","IDS_PCZC085_YAMAMOTO_MITSUBISHI_B1M_DESCRIPTION":"From 1924 the service of Yamamoto Isoroku was closely associated with naval aviation. At the test site in Kasumigaura, when Yamamoto was the senior officer of this flying school, the latest equipment was tested, including the Mitsubishi B1M, which became one of the first mass-produced torpedo bombers of the Japanese fleet. The aircraft could fly at a maximum speed of 210 km/h, its armament consisted of four 7.7 mm machine-guns, and a 457 mm torpedo or two 240 kg bombs.\\n\\nAfterwards, when Yamamoto held leadership positions equal to the rank of an Admiral at the Navy Aviation Bureau of the Navy Ministry, he continued to actively supervise the development and implementation of new types of aircraft, including G2H, one of the first Japanese long-range land-based bombers, and bomber G3M Nell, and torpedo bomber G4M Betty that became famous during the Pacific War.","IDS_PCZC086_YAMAMOTO_CALLIGRAPHY_TOOLS":"Traditional Tools for Japanese Calligraphy","IDS_PCZC086_YAMAMOTO_CALLIGRAPHY_TOOLS_DESCRIPTION":"Yamamoto Isoroku preferred to spend his leisure time playing shogi, a traditional Japanese board game in the same family as chess, with his subordinates. He dedicated moments of seclusion to calligraphy, as he was a big admirer of it.\\n\\nIn Japan, calligraphy, also known as shodō (the way of writing), was a form of artistic writing and a kind of meditation practice requiring the utmost concentration. This calligraphy set includes items that were selected by a centuries-old tradition: a brush (\\\"fude\\\"), an inkstick (\\\"sumi\\\"), an inkstone (\\\"suzuri\\\"), a paper weight (\\\"bunchin\\\"), and a brush rest (\\\"fudeoki\\\").","IDS_PCZC087_YAMAMOTO_CALLIGRAPHY":"Calligraphy Sketch By Yamamoto Isoroku","IDS_PCZC087_YAMAMOTO_CALLIGRAPHY_DESCRIPTION":"After the victory at Pearl Harbor, Yamamoto Isoroku became extremely popular not only in the navy, but throughout Japan. The Admiral's followers often asked him to send them samples of calligraphy, which he was fond of.\\n\\nShodō characters were supposed to translate the mind and soul state of the writer. Their exact meaning was very difficult to translate, as every character can have many connotations.","IDS_PCZC088_YAMAMOTO_PEARL_HARBOR":"The Map of the U.S.A. Naval Base in Pearl Harbor, Japan, 1941","IDS_PCZC088_YAMAMOTO_PEARL_HARBOR_DESCRIPTION":"After assuming command of the Combined Fleet, Yamamoto started revision of the Japanese naval strategy for a possible confrontation with the U.S.A. This caused a conflict with the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff who based their plan on defense and a decisive battle with battleships as the core of the forces. Yamamoto thought that the only chance to win the war with the U.S.A. was to regain the initiative and make a sudden crushing blow to the U.S.A. fleet.\\n\\nIn spring 1940, he raised the idea of a massive air attack on the U.S.A. naval base in Pearl Harbor. Further details were elaborated by his staff at the beginning of the following year. In December 1941, the famous attack was performed. The diplomats were delayed with the transfer of an official note to the US government, which resulted in an attack \\\"without declaration of war\\\", this was not what the Admiral intended. He subsequently openly expressed his discontent with this fact to his colleagues.","IDS_PCZC089_YAMAMOTO_G4M1_MODEL_11_BETTY":"Bomber Mitsubishi G4M Betty No. 323","IDS_PCZC089_YAMAMOTO_G4M1_MODEL_11_BETTY_DESCRIPTION":"While in Rabaul in April 1943, Yamamoto decided to visit garrisons on the islands nearest to the front line to raise the spirits of the soldiers defending there. On April 13, the local command sent an encrypted radiogram to the islands with details of the time and place of arrival of the Commander-in-Chief, assuming that the Americans would be unable to crack the newly updated code within a few hours.\\n\\nIn the early morning of April 18, two G4M1 Betty bombers from the 705th Air Group, escorted by six A6M Zero fighters, left Rabaul. The Commander-in-Chief was in the pilot's cabin of bomber No. 323. They were intercepted by 14 U.S.A. P-38 Lightning fighters in the skies above Bougainville island. A few minutes later, bomber No. 323, riddled with bullets, crashed into the jungle. As the medical examination later showed, the Admiral was mortally wounded while the plane was still in the air.","IDS_PCZC090_YAMAMOTO_LOCKHEED_P_38G":"Fighter Lockheed\\nP-38G Lightning Miss Virginia No. 147","IDS_PCZC090_YAMAMOTO_LOCKHEED_P_38G_DESCRIPTION":"The radiogram, which contained information about the time and route of the commander-in-chief's visits to the islands of Bougainville and Shortland, was intercepted and deciphered by US naval intelligence on April 14, 1943. US President Franklin D. Roosevelt personally ordered Navy command to \\\"get Yamamoto\\\".\\n\\nRear Admiral Mitscher who was commanding air forces on the Solomon Islands assigned the 339th Squadron to the task code-named Vengeance, as only that squadron had P-38G Lightning fighters with sufficient operational range. In a quick air battle above Bougainville, they lost one P-38G and shot down the aircraft with Yamamoto and his staff on board. The Bomber Betty carrying the Admiral was shot down by the fighter No. 147 controlled by First Lieutenant Rex T. Barber.","IDS_PCZC091_WOWS_ECO":"Economic Reforms","IDS_PCZC091_WOWS_ECO_DESCRIPTION":"First and foremost, Update 0.5.12 will be remembered by players and developers alike for its changes to the in-game economy.

Instances of their embodiment in metal were more of an exception to the rule. One such exception were the King George V-class battleships to which HMS Duke of York belonged. Each of the ships carried ten 14-inch (356 mm) Mk.VII guns, which were mounted in one Mk.II twin turret and two Mk.III quadruple turrets.\\n\\nKing George V-class battleships couldn't boast the largest caliber of guns, and her guns had a lot of mechanical internals which didn't always work reliably, but under combat conditions the ships' main guns proved highly accurate and quite destructive. During the Battle of the North Cape, Duke of York scored a hit on the first salvo, disabling Scharnhorst's foremost turrets. During the first two hours of the battle, the German battleship lost all of her combat capability after taking hits from Duke of York's main guns, whereas the British ship sustained no significant damage from Scharnhorst's counterfire.","IDS_PCZC109_NY2018_SCHARNHORST_RADAR":"Scharnhorst's Forward Radar Set","IDS_PCZC109_NY2018_SCHARNHORST_RADAR_DESCRIPTION":"At the beginning of 1942, Scharnhorst was equipped with new FuMO 27 radars.

These radars could detect an enemy ship at a distance of 25 km.\\n\\nHowever, during the Battle of the North Cape, the British ships surpassed Scharnhorst in both the quality and quantity of radar equipment. What's more, in an attempt to avoid detection, the radar systems on the Scharnhorst had been turned off. In doing so, Scharnhorst was unable to detect enemy ships in time. The first salvos fired by the British cruisers came as a total surprise to the German ship. One of the first hits crippled the forward FuMO 27 set. Under polar night conditions, Scharnhorst, blinded by the loss of her radar, fell right into the trap set by the British.","IDS_PCZC110_NY2018_NORFOLKGK":"Main Battery Turret of Cruiser Norfolk","IDS_PCZC110_NY2018_NORFOLKGK_DESCRIPTION":"HMS Norfolk belonged to the third series of County-class heavy cruisers designed under the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, which defined such cruisers as warships of up to 10,000 tons displacement carrying guns no larger than 8 inches (203 mm) in caliber.

The ship played a key role in the operation to destroy German battleship Scharnhorst in December 1943.\\n\\nAccording to the plan, the British cruisers were to force Scharnhorst to change course towards battleship Duke of York, and they succeeded. In the battle that ensued, Duke of York, despite her main guns malfunctioning, maintained a very high rate of fire, hitting the enemy over and over again. In total, in the Battle of the North Cape, the British battleship fired 450 main battery shells, incapacitating almost all artillery guns aboard the enemy warship and forcing her to reduce speed, after which Scharnhorst was finished off by torpedoes.","IDS_PCZC116_NY2018_SCHARNHORST_SHIP":"Battleship Scharnhorst","IDS_PCZC116_NY2018_SCHARNHORST_SHIP_DESCRIPTION":"Battleship Scharnhorst was commissioned into the fleet in 1939.

None of the Allied ships that could pose a threat to her could keep up with her.\\n\\nThe intention of Germany to respect the international restrictions in the early stage of designing the ship resulted in the fact that only 283 mm guns were mounted on her. That meant she could be classified as a battlecruiser, and reduced her capability to face the newest British battleships on an equal footing.","IDS_PCZC117_NY2018_JAMAICA_SHIP":"Cruiser Jamaica","IDS_PCZC117_NY2018_JAMAICA_SHIP_DESCRIPTION":"HMS Jamaica was a light cruiser of the Fiji class (also known as Crown Colony class).

All these ships were armed with four or five 149 mm guns and two quadruple 533 mm torpedo tubes. Their maximum speed could reach 37 knots.\\n\\nWhile searching for the Allied convoy on the morning of December 26, 1943, due to stormy weather and the arctic night conditions, the destroyers lost sight of their flagship just before the first engagement with the British ships. After a few hours, the commander of the German naval force, Konteradmiral Bey, ordered them to return to the base. In the battle that followed, Scharnhorst was left alone and sunk. Destroyers, which could seriously disrupt the actions of the British forces and provide a chance for the battleship to escape the trap, safely returned to the Norwegian fjords without even facing the enemy.","IDS_PCZC119_NY2018_BANI":"Grand Cross of The Order of the Bath","IDS_PCZC119_NY2018_BANI_DESCRIPTION":"The Most Honourable Order of the Bath is one of the most senior British Orders.

The biggest naval base of the French Navy on the Atlantic coast is also located in Brest.\\n\\nIn March–April 1940, Bretagne and heavy cruiser Algérie, as part of the special Force X, fulfilled an unusual mission to carry gold across the Atlantic Ocean. The German submarines were stalking them from below, and the Kriegsmarine raiders—battleships and cruisers—often went out to hunt. That is why using warships as carriers of the precious metal was more than justified. Bretagne and Algérie delivered 147 tons of gold from Toulon to Halifax that was then used to pay for the French government's military contracts placed in the U.S.A.

The maximum speed of the new French battleship exceeded 30 knots which made her an extremely dangerous hunter for cruisers.\\n\\nWhen World War II broke out, Dunkerque was unusually in demand since at that time the Allies didn't have other modern high-speed battleships capable of countering German raiders. In Autumn 1939, Dunkerque and her sister ship Strasbourg operated in the Atlantic against the German \\\"pocket\\\" battleships Deutschland and Admiral Graf Spee. That same year, in November, amid a violent storm, Dunkerque and the British battleship Hood set out on a hunt for German Scharnhorst-class battleships.

He joined the army as a private during the Thirty Years' War but displayed such daring and skill that he rose meteorically in rank, becoming a Marshal of France at 33. Turenne's innovative approach based on fearless maneuvering on the battlefield and concentrating troops along the main sector of the front helped him secure several brilliant victories during the wars with Spain and Holland. The glorious Marshal's life was taken by an enemy cannonball in his next battle.\\n\\nThe French Navy paid their respects to Turenne by assigning his name to two large battle units—a 100-gun ship-of-the-line launched in 1854 and an ironclad that entered service in 1882. Early in the 20th century, France was considering a project to build an \\\"all-big-gun\\\" battleship as a next step in the evolution of the Danton-class pre-dreadnought battleships, also to be named after one of the most prominent figures in French history.","IDS_PCZC165_VIVALAFRANCE_NORMAND":"Coat of Arms of Normandy","IDS_PCZC165_VIVALAFRANCE_NORMAND_DESCRIPTION":"The lead ship in a series of French battleships which superseded the Bretagne-class ships was named after Normandy, a historical province in the north of France housing two of the country's largest sea ports, Rouen and Le Havre.

All of the battleships were ordered early in 1915 but none of them was even laid down.\\n\\nThe new battleships were supposed to have been more powerful than their predecessors, the Normandie-class warships, which were to carry twelve 340 mm guns placed in three turrets. However, the development of new guns of a larger caliber could entail unacceptable construction delays.

The Cardinal himself was involved in designing the exterior decor and armament of one of the most powerful ships of that time—the 70-gun Couronne (\\\"Crown\\\").\\n\\nThe first warship to be named after Richelieu was an ironclad that joined the fleet in 1876. The next large combat unit of the Marine Nationale to carry the Cardinal's name was a battleship (displacement: 35,000 tons) that was laid down at the Brest Arsenal in 1935. That battleship turned out to be one of the best ships of her type in Europe.","IDS_PCZC168_VIVALAFRANCE_ELSASS":"Coat of Arms of Alsace","IDS_PCZC168_VIVALAFRANCE_ELSASS_DESCRIPTION":"The geographical location of the Alsace province on the border between France and Germany predetermined their rivalry for this territory that lasted from the 19th century right until the end of World War II. Historically, the province comprised two regions which later transformed into departments—Haut-Rhin and Bas-Rhin—so the first Coat of Arms of Alsace, approved in 1948, comprised elements from the Coats of Arms of both departments.\\n\\nIn 1939, France found out that Germany was pursuing a program for the construction of H-class battleships. In response, a decision was made to lay down two battleships capable of withstanding the new threat. One of the draft projects, the most powerful one, provided for twelve 380 mm main guns placed in three turrets, a speed of 32 knots and a 350-mm-thick main armor belt. A construction order was placed in April 1940. One month later, names were suggested for the future steel monsters. The first on the list was Alsace, apparently in the teeth of the geopolitical rival. But the defeat of the French army, and the country's capitulation in June 1940, crippled plans to build the most powerful battleships the French Republic ever had.","IDS_PCZC169_VIVALAFRANCE_GASCONHA":"Coat of Arms of Gascogne","IDS_PCZC169_VIVALAFRANCE_GASCONHA_DESCRIPTION":"In 1938, driven by further aggravation of the international situation, the French government decided to build a second pair of Richelieu-class battleships. However, significant changes were made to the project designs at the development stage with the last ship carrying the name of a historical province in the south-west of France—Gascogne—designed almost from scratch.\\n\\nGascogne's main difference from Richelieu was a more conventional placement of the main battery turrets—at the fore and aft ends of the ship. Other important changes were the shift of the propulsion unit closer to the ship's fore end and reinforcement of her AA defenses by increasing the number of 100 mm and 37 mm guns. The keel-laying that had been postponed several times was ultimately to take place in the summer of 1940. But after France withdrew from the war in June of the same year, preparations for the construction of the battleship ceased. The preceding warship Gascogne, one in a series of Normandie-class battleships, did not fare any better. Laid down in 1913 while still under construction, she was decommissioned for scrap.","IDS_PCZC170_VIVALAFRANCE_305MMGUN":"305 mm Twin Turret","IDS_PCZC170_VIVALAFRANCE_305MMGUN_DESCRIPTION":"In 1910–1911, specially for the first French dreadnoughts of the Courbet class, a new 305 mm twin turret was developed. The main advantage of the new construction, which distinguished it from previous ones, was inclined armored plates which turned out to be more durable. However, the guns in the turrets were almost the same as those mounted on the last French pre-dreadnought battleships of the Danton class.\\n\\nThe turrets had up to 290 mm of armor and the loading gear was designed to fire up to two 432 kg AP shells per minute. The main disadvantage of Courbet's turrets was a small gun elevation angle (12 degrees only), which significantly decreased the ship's firing range. That shortcoming was fixed only during a major ship refit of 1922–1924 when the angle was increased to 23 degrees.","IDS_PCZC171_VIVALAFRANCE_340MMGUN":"340 mm Quadruple Turret","IDS_PCZC171_VIVALAFRANCE_340MMGUN_DESCRIPTION":"In 1912, a decision was finally reached to proceed with building the third series of battleships for the French Navy. However, plans to make new ships of the Normandie class more powerful than their predecessors were hindered by production constraints, as at that time French shipyards were not big enough to allow for any significant increase in the size of warships. Moreover, the French didn't have guns that were more powerful than the 340 mm guns, which were to be mounted on the Bretagne-class battleships that were at their final stages of construction, and the design of a new gun weapon system would be too expensive timewise. Ultimately, engineers came up with an innovative solution: to mount the main guns intended for the Normandie-class battleships in quad turrets.\\n\\nThe new turret, which would have become the first quad turret ever mounted on a ship, was designed to have a rate of fire of up to two shots per minute. The front armor plates protecting the guns were to have been 340 mm thick. In total, plans were made to build 31 units: each of the five Normandie-class battleships laid down in 1913–1914 was supposed to carry three such turrets, while the Lyon-class warships ordered in 1915 were designed to carry as many as four.","IDS_PCZC172_VIVALAFRANCE_380MMGUN":"380 mm Quadruple Turret","IDS_PCZC172_VIVALAFRANCE_380MMGUN_DESCRIPTION":"The 380 mm guns of the Richelieu-class battleships were the most powerful guns ever carried by French warships. The decision to place main guns in quad turrets was necessitated by the intention to provide the new battleships with the most powerful armament allowed by limited displacement without decreasing their speed and armor protection.\\n\\nThe design of the 380 mm quad turrets was in many ways based on the construction of 330 mm turrets used on the previous—Dunkerque—class of battleships. This allowed to promptly do away with the design phase and commence construction. Eventually, such turrets were mounted aboard two battleships only, Richelieu and Jean Bart, although plans were made for similar units to be carried by Clemenceau (laid down in 1939) and Gascogne (suggested keel-laying year: 1940). Quad turrets housing 380 mm guns were also envisaged by one of the draft projects for the Alsace-class battleships developed in the spring of 1940.","IDS_PCZC173_VIVALAFRANCE_LOIRE130":"Flying Boat Loire 130","IDS_PCZC173_VIVALAFRANCE_LOIRE130_DESCRIPTION":"During World War II, Loire 130, a monoplane designed in 1933–1934, was the most commonly used seaplane in the French Navy.

Its armament included two 7.5 mm machine guns and up to 150 kg of bombs.\\n\\nProduction of this aircraft commenced in 1936, and, by the beginning of World War II, the French Navy had more than fifty flying boats of this type that replaced almost all other models of seaplane. The reliable and easy-to-maintain Loire 130 was used as a scout, transport, training, and search and rescue aircraft. It was carried by nearly every French cruiser and catapult-equipped battleship such as Dunkerque, Strasbourg, Lorraine, and Richelieu.

In 1939, the French Government placed an order in the U.S.A. for several dozen of these biplanes for the French Navy. Their production, however, was delayed, and to fill the order a decision was made to provide France with 50 Helldiver bombers from operational U.S. Navy divisions. To accommodate French standards, the planes were renamed as Curtiss CW-77, and were urgently reequipped with French machine guns and camouflaged accordingly.\\n\\nHowever, as America had declared neutrality, it couldn't deliver bombers directly to France. A plan was devised to move the biplanes to Halifax, Canada, where they were to be fetched by the French aircraft carrier Bearn. At the last moment, the planes were prohibited to cross the Canadian border by air. They had to be dragged across the border using tractors and trucks available in the vicinity. At the beginning of June 1940, all biplanes were finally loaded on the carrier. The news about the capitulation of France reached Bearn near the island of Martinique.

At the early stage of design, it was planned to build a series of ships based on the design of the U.S. flagship in the Battle of Manila Bay, cruiser Olympia, with some improvements. According to that design, the ship would have had a displacement of 6,000 tons, combined armament including heavy and rapid-fire guns, and a speed of 20 knots. However, at one of the American shipyards, cruiser Varyag was laid down for the Russian Navy. She was bigger than Olympia's descendants, carried 152 mm guns, and her speed was up to 23 knots. That forced the American engineers to revise the design.\\n\\nWhen St. Louis entered the U.S. Navy, she had a displacement of 10,000 tons, fourteen 152 mm guns, and a speed of 22 knots. The armor belt protecting the propulsion provided a significant advantage compared to other same-type ships with rapid-fire artillery, most of which were protected by an armored deck.\\n\\nAfter her trials, the beautiful new ship with four steam stacks and snow-white sides shining moved to San Diego from New York.

Such ships should be high-speed, large, and able to operate on the open seas, far from naval bases.\\n\\nAs a result, in 1905, a project to create a cruiser with a displacement of 3,700 tons and a speed of 24 knots was undertaken. Very high boards were one of her constructive peculiarities, which allowed her to maintain a high speed, even during a storm. Originally, the armament of the ship should have included only 76 mm guns, which were recognized as powerful enough to counter destroyers of that time, but during the design, some of them were replaced with 127 mm guns.\\n\\nIn 1908, under the project, Chester, Salem, and Birmingham were commissioned. They were the only ships that officially entered the U.S. Navy as \\\"scout cruisers\\\". During her service, the lead ship of the series participated in a few spectacular naval parades, escorted the steam ship Carpathia with surviving passengers from the cruise liner Titanic on her way to New York, and, in 1914, played a key role in capturing the Mexican port of Veracruz. During World War I, this cruiser even attempted to ram a German submarine, but failed.\\n\\nIn 1921, USS Chester ended her active service, a few years before the first generation of light cruisers of the Omaha class joined the U.S. Navy.","IDS_PCZC178_AA_OMAHA":"USS Omaha as a Part of the Pacific Fleet, 1924","IDS_PCZC178_AA_OMAHA_DESCRIPTION":"Before entering World War I, the U.S. Navy faced a lack of modern cruisers that could perform long-range reconnaissance missions and cover squadrons of dreadnought battleships from attacks from enemy light forces.\\n\\nThe design process of a new cruiser class took too long, but as a result, the U.S. engineers managed to take into account the experience earned in the previous war. The lead ship under the name of Omaha, a city in the state of Nebraska, was laid down at the end of 1918. After her, in 1923–1925, nine more ships were commissioned.\\n\\nThe new cruisers were intentionally designed with a shape reminiscent of the silhouette of the Clemson-class destroyers, the intention being to make it harder for the enemy to know which ship they encounter. Right until the early 1930s, Omaha and her sister ships formed the core of the U.S. Navy cruiser forces. However, from the moment the U.S.A. joined World War II, they became out-of-date. Because of this, the Navy command used them mainly for performing tasks on minor battlefields.\\n\\nUSS Omaha successfully hunted for the German blockade runners in the Atlantic, and, in 1944, supported the Allies landing in Southern France with fire.\\n\\nIn March 1943, her sister ship, USS Richmond, took part in the Battle of the Komandorski Islands in the Bering Sea, where a small U.S. squadron recklessly attacked a mighty Japanese force and made it renege their mission and turn back.","IDS_PCZC179_AA_SALT_LAKE_CITY":"USS Salt Lake City in the Battle of the Komandorski Islands, 1943","IDS_PCZC179_AA_SALT_LAKE_CITY_DESCRIPTION":"Cruiser Salt Lake City, named after the capital of the state of Utah, was laid down in 1927. She was built very quickly and commissioned in just two and a half years, even more quickly than the lead ship of the series, Pensacola, that was laid down a few months earlier.\\n\\nThe previous stage of design took much more time. The idea to create a 10,000-ton, high-speed cruiser with 203 mm artillery appeared in 1918. Until 1926, dozens of versions of such ships were considered, with different armament, armor, and speed.\\n\\nSalt Lake City and Pensacola entered service in 1929–1930 and had an impressive firepower of ten 203 mm guns. At the same time, due to their weak armor, they were classified as light cruisers. Only in 1931 was their classification brought in line with international classification, and Pensacola with Salt Lake City became \\\"heavier\\\".\\n\\nThe service of USS Salt Lake City during World War II was very intense. Twice her armor and firepower were tested in artillery combats with heavy Japanese cruisers. First, in October 1942, in the Battle of Cape Esperance near the Solomon Islands, when the U.S. ships caught the Japanese force off guard and managed to cause serious losses among them, forcing them to flee. In March 1943, a small squadron with Salt Lake City at the core intercepted the Japanese cover forces, escorting the transports with assault troopers on board, near the Komandorski Islands. The enemy force included two heavy cruisers, each of which was more powerful than their overseas counterpart. However, the U.S. squadron engaged in the fight and, within a few hours, Salt Lake City was boldly maneuvering and firing at an enemy twice as powerful as the American ship. The weak armor of the cruiser couldn't withstand hits of 203 mm shells, which nearly led to a tragic finale. However, both Japanese cruisers were damaged by Salt Lake City's guns and had used almost all of their ammunition. The Japanese Admiral who faced the stubborn opposition chose to stop the operation and retreat.","IDS_PCZC180_AA_NEW_ORLEANS":"USS New Orleans in the Battle of Cape Engaño, 1944","IDS_PCZC180_AA_NEW_ORLEANS_DESCRIPTION":"In 1929, when eight cruisers with 203 mm artillery were already at different stages of construction, the U.S. Navy command concluded that the Washington-generation ships were insufficiently protected. In this context, at the beginning of the following year, a new cruiser was designed. In consideration of international treaties in relation to displacement and armament (10,000 tons, 203 mm guns), she had significantly improved armor. The ship's vital parts were protected from artillery equal in caliber to her own—in this regard the new project surpassed all the previous ones. USS New Orleans became the lead ship in a series of seven vessels. This ship, named after the city in Louisiana, was commissioned in 1934.\\n\\nDuring World War II, New Orleans-class cruisers took part in numerous military operations. The geography of their campaigns and battles extends from Spitsbergen and the shores of North Africa to Australia and the Japanese islands.\\n\\nThree ships of the series were destroyed in the Battle of Savo Island—extremely unsuccessful for the Allies—in the archipelago of the Solomon Islands in August 1942, but in the following three years the remaining ships were able to strike back: a total of 64 battle stars were awarded to New Orleans-class cruisers, becoming some of the most honored combat units of the U.S. Navy.\\n\\nNew Orleans, as the lead ship, in October 1944, was able to avenge the death of her comrades, taking part in the Battle of Cape Engaño, where four Japanese aircraft carriers were sunk.","IDS_PCZC181_AA_HELENA":"USS Helena in the Battle of Cape Esperance, 1942","IDS_PCZC181_AA_HELENA_DESCRIPTION":"The information that Japan was building Mogami-class cruisers armed with fifteen 155 mm guns shocked the U.S. Navy command. The project of a light cruiser with 152 mm artillery, which had been in development since 1930, was quickly revised, and her four triple turrets were complemented with the fifth one. This was the birth of the Brooklyn class.\\n\\nIn 1935, when most of these cruisers had already been laid down, an updated project was prepared. The advanced design had a new propulsion and a full-fledged dual-purpose artillery consisting of the newest twin 127 mm turrets. A year later, two ships—USS St. Louis and USS Helena—were laid down, becoming part of the Navy in 1939.\\n\\nLight cruiser Helena became one of the victims of the Japanese assault on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, being hit by a torpedo once. After completion of the repair works in the summer of 1942, the cruiser actively joined the fight for the Solomon Islands, taking part in several major battles, the most successful of which being a night battle of Cape Esperance in October 1942. Thanks to the newest radar mounted on it, USS Helena was the first to disclose the approach of a Japanese squadron. Allowing the enemy ships to approach at a close distance, the cruiser was the first to burst her rapid fire at the Japanese. USS Helena's shells proved fatal for destroyer Fubuki and set cruiser Furutaka ablaze. The result of the battle was a hasty retreat of the defeated Japanese squadron.\\n\\nCruiser Helena's promising career tragically ended in July 1943, when three 610 mm torpedoes from Japanese destroyers sank her in the Battle of Kula Gulf.","IDS_PCZC182_AA_ATLANTA":"USS Atlanta in the Battle of Guadalcanal, 1942","IDS_PCZC182_AA_ATLANTA_DESCRIPTION":"Atlanta-class ships occupy a special place in the history of the development of U.S. cruisers. They owe their appearance to the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited displacement for new cruisers to 8,000 tons. It was impossible to design a full-fledged multi-purpose cruiser in this context. At the same time, the successful tests of 127 mm dual-purpose twin mounts gave impulse to the Navy command to create a cruiser with such turrets as her main battery.\\n\\nThe first four ships under this project were laid down in the spring of 1940. The lead ship, USS Atlanta, named after the state capital of Georgia, entered service in late 1941. Despite the impressive number of dual-purpose guns mounted on the cruiser (sixteen), she was not considered an AA defense cruiser and had to fulfil primarily the duties of a scout and destroyer flotilla leader.\\n\\nHaving arrived at the Pacific Theater of operations, USS Atlanta immediately engaged in active combat activities, taking part in the Battle of Midway, the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, and a number of less significant operations. On the night of November 13, 1942, the cruiser was in the epicenter of the battle, known as the Battle of Friday the 13th—one of the most controversial battles in the history of the war in the Pacific Ocean. The American squadron, consisting of five cruisers and eight destroyers, intercepted the Japanese task force (two battleships, a cruiser, and 11 destroyers) sent for the attack on Guadalcanal. The U.S. ships, thanks to their radars, were the first to detect the enemy, but were inexcusably late to open fire. As a result, two columns, American and Japanese, literally collapsed one into the other on a dark tropical night, breaking the formation. In the resulting pileup, where they almost made contact, the sides used not only torpedoes and main battery against each other, but even AA guns. From the very beginning of the battle, Atlanta, furiously shooting in all directions from her rapid-fire mounts, was hit many times, including by one or two torpedoes. For a small, lightly armored cruiser, it was enough, and before the day was over she sank.","IDS_PCZC183_AA_COLUMBIA":"USS Columbia Fends off the Attacks of Japanese Aviation near the Island of Bougainville, 1943","IDS_PCZC183_AA_COLUMBIA_DESCRIPTION":"When World War II broke out in September 1939, all international agreements imposing limits on the naval weapons development ceased to exist. The US Navy Command could replenish their growing fleet with light cruisers without considering their water displacement. However, the world conflict was intensifying, so they had to act quickly. In order to save the time required to design a project from a scratch, the recent \\\"big\\\" light cruisers—St. Louis and Helena—were used as a basis for the new project.\\n\\nA requirement to reinforce the ships AA capabilities and desire to mount advanced gunfire control systems and surveillance radars led to the decision to remove one of the 152 mm turrets. The resulting light cruiser, armed with twelve 152 mm guns, was in no way inferior to most ships of her type in terms of main battery firepower, and outmatched all of them in terms of AA gun strength and an abundance of modern equipment.\\n\\nThe second ship in the series, USS Columbia, named after the state capital of South Carolina, was constructed almost concurrently with the lead ship, USS Cleveland, and was commissioned in July 1942.\\n\\nThe most impressive episode of her combat service was her participation in the Bougainville Campaign (the Solomon Islands) in November 1943. On November 1, four Cleveland-class cruisers, including USS Columbia, delivered extremely intense fire with their rapid-firing guns on the enemy positions on the island. Several hours later, during the night battle that later became known as the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay, they managed to fend off an attack by a powerful Japanese squadron on the Americans landing place on the Bougainville island without loss.\\n\\nShortly afterwards, in the morning of November 2, USS Columbia, together with her three sister ships, repelled a massive enemy air raid during which they shot down more than 20 aircraft, again without loss.","IDS_PCZC184_AA_CLEVELAND":"Cleveland-class Cruiser and Independence-class Aircraft Carrier, 1944","IDS_PCZC184_AA_CLEVELAND_DESCRIPTION":"Cleveland-class cruisers were the world's most numerous series of this type of ship. After USS Cleveland and USS Columbia, 24 more warships were put into operation. One of the laid down ships was completed much later, as a missile cruiser, another one was dismantled in the shipyard. Nine ships, originally ordered as Cleveland-class cruisers, entered service as Independence-class light aircraft carriers, the design of which was, nevertheless, based on the cruiser's layout.\\n\\nNumerous, well-armed Cleveland-class cruisers, charged with AA guns and high-tech equipment, became indispensable in the second half of the Pacific Campaign. As a rule, they acted as part of the high-speed carrier forces, and often had to operate side-by-side with their aircraft-carrying \\\"relatives\\\".\\n\\nFor example, in October 1944, shortly before the Battle of Leyte, the largest battle in the naval history, the TF38 Fast Carrier Task Force simultaneously included seven Cleveland-class cruisers and eight Independence-class aircraft carriers!","IDS_PCZC185_AA_BALTIMORE":"USS Baltimore off the coast of the Philippine Islands, 1944","IDS_PCZC185_AA_BALTIMORE_DESCRIPTION":"With the outbreak of World War II, the United States began the creation of a new heavy cruiser project, with the ship's size no longer restricted by international treaties that now ceased to exist. The first vessel built under the new project was USS Baltimore, enlisted in the Navy in April 1943. The ship was named after the largest city of the state of Maryland. After the lead ship, fifteen more vessels were laid down, which made Baltimore-class cruisers the most numerous series of heavy cruisers in the world.\\n\\nIn their overall layout and silhouette, they resembled their \\\"light\\\" Cleveland-class counterparts, and had an equally powerful dual-purpose artillery consisting of twelve 127 mm guns, complementing the main battery—nine 203 mm guns. Seven Baltimore-class cruisers took part in the battles of World War II.\\n\\nBesides protecting the aircraft carriers with its powerful AA defense, these ships were quite useful in attacking the enemy's onshore positions, both in the Pacific Ocean and during the landing of the Allies in France. Unlike Cleveland-class cruisers, overcharged with weaponry, which prevented their overhaul and predetermined their short life, many Baltimore-class cruisers were re-equipped and remained in service until the 1960s and 1970s, having taken part in combat action in Korea and Vietnam.","IDS_PCZC186_AA_WORCESTER":"USS Worcester after Commissioning, 1949","IDS_PCZC186_AA_WORCESTER_DESCRIPTION":"Cruiser Worcester, named after a city in the state of Massachusetts, was laid down in January 1945. The U.S. Navy command had considered an idea to create a ship armed with a dual-purpose, 152 mm caliber gun since 1941, when the increased menace from the air became absolutely clear.\\n\\nThe hardships of developing a dual-purpose 152 mm turret and disputes around the very concept of such a cruiser delayed the development of the new ship for several years. Changes were also made during her construction.\\n\\nWhen the Japanese demonstrated their tactics of kamikaze pilots to the U.S. Navy, the latter decided not to mount 40 mm Bofors guns on new cruisers, but replace them with much more powerful 76 mm AA defense guns instead. Charged with intricate mechanisms, the new twin 152 mm turret proved to be very heavy and bulky. As a result, the \\\"light\\\" cruiser, with six such turrets mounted, was comparable in size to her heavy Baltimore-class counterparts.\\n\\nUSS Worcester and her only sister ship, USS Roanoke, were commissioned only in 1948–1949, when World War II was long over. In total, four ships were ordered under the project, but the order for two ships, one of which had been already laid down by that time, was abolished in August 1945, when the victory of the U.S.A. in the war with Japan became a fact.\\n\\nAfter joining the U.S. Navy, USS Worcester spent most of her service outside the native waters, \\\"demonstrating her flag\\\" in the Mediterranean, Latin America, Northern Europe, and the Pacific.\\n\\nFor participation in the Korean War in 1950–1953, the ship was awarded with two battle stars.\\n\\nIn 1970, already obsolete due to the development of AA defense missiles, USS Worcester was removed from the fleet lists.","IDS_PCZC187_AA_DES_MOINES":"USS Des Moines during Sea Trials, 1948","IDS_PCZC187_AA_DES_MOINES_DESCRIPTION":"Night battles, often short, with rapidly changing conditions, forced the U.S. Navy command to create rapid-fire 203 mm guns capable of reigning down the maximum amount of metal and explosives on the enemy in a short period of time.\\n\\nA triple 203 mm turret with an automatic loading mechanism was created at the end of 1945. As its weight and dimensions significantly exceeded those of similar turrets already used by the Navy and those still to be mounted on heavy cruisers under construction, a new ship had to be designed simultaneously with the new turret. The lead heavy cruiser, named Des Moines after the city in the state of Iowa, was laid down in May 1945. The vessel was supposed to be followed by another eleven vessels, but because World War II ended, only three were actually built. Another laid down ship was dismantled in the shipyard.\\n\\nAfter joining the fleet in 1948–1949, the same-class Des Moines, Salem, and Newport News reigned supreme in the open seas of the post-war world.\\n\\nTheir creation significantly influenced the design of heavy artillery ships of the U.S.S.R. in the early 1950s. For example, Soviet heavy cruiser Project 66 was developed with an eye to Des Moines.\\n\\nWithout a chance to use her main battery against surface targets in the years of active service, Des Moines-class cruisers, as a rule, performed the honorary duties of flagships.\\n\\nThe firepower of USS Newport News was in demand when attacking onshore targets during the Vietnam War.\\n\\nTwo out of the three ships of the series were dismantled in the 1990s and 2000s, while USS Salem is still kept as a museum ship in Quincy, Massachusetts.","IDS_PCZC188_AA_127MM_MARK5_6":"127 mm Mark 5/6 Gun","IDS_PCZC188_AA_127MM_MARK5_6_DESCRIPTION":"Five-inch (127 mm) caliber guns were very popular in the U.S. Navy. The 127 mm guns (Mark 1) first appeared in the arsenal of the U.S. Navy cruisers in the 1880s. By 1901, a new, long-barreled, five-inch Mark 5 gun had been developed, and a few years later, its slightly modified version, the Mark 6, was created. Despite that, all loading operations were done manually, Mark 5/6 guns could fire 6 to 8 AP shells, weighing 22 to 27 kg, per minute.\\n\\n127 mm Mark 5/6 guns were mounted as the main battery on Chester-class light cruisers, and as secondary battery on Delaware-class battleships. Moreover, they were mounted on a number of older ships. For example, in 1904–1907, cruiser Albany got ten 127 mm guns instead of her 152 mm and 120 mm guns made in England.\\n\\nIn the 1910s, the Mark 5/6 was replaced by the 127 mm Mark 7/8 gun which had a higher rate of fire and better penetration capability. However, even during World War II, a few Mark 5/6 mounts could still be seen in the arsenal of auxiliary vessels and coastal batteries.","IDS_PCZC189_AA_152MM_MARK6":"152 mm Mark 6 Gun","IDS_PCZC189_AA_152MM_MARK6_DESCRIPTION":"Development of a new rapid-firing 152 mm Mark 6 gun was completed by 1900. Over the next decade, this artillery system, as well as its modified version, Mark 8, became widespread in the U.S. Navy.\\n\\nThe gun's rate of fire was about 6 shots per minute, with a shell weight of around 48 kg. The elevation angle limited to 15 degrees ensured a firing range of over 13.5 km. 152 mm Mark 6/8 guns became standard in the auxiliary artillery of U.S. Navy battleships and armored cruisers built in the 1900s. Only on St. Louis-class cruisers were they mounted as the main battery.\\n\\nAfter signing of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, most of the ships of the pre-dreadnought era were scrapped, and 152 mm guns were massively passed on to the United States coastal artillery.","IDS_PCZC190_AA_152MM_MARK16":"152 mm Mark 16 Twin Turret","IDS_PCZC190_AA_152MM_MARK16_DESCRIPTION":"Especially for Omaha-class light cruisers, a new 152 mm gun, the Mark 12, with an increased barrel length and a high initial shell velocity, was developed. According to the initial design, the armament of these ships consisted of ten single deck and casemate mounts. But then, in 1920, in order to surpass British C-class cruisers in broadside firepower, the Mark 16 twin-turret was developed. While the casemate-mounted artillery elevation angle was limited to 20 degrees, the maximum elevation angle of the turret barrels was 30 degrees, which ensured a theoretical firing range of more than 23 km.\\n\\nThe creation of the Mark 16 turret was a milestone in the history of the development of cruiser types. The technological level of the previous, pre-dreadnought era ships did not allow for the creation of sufficiently reliable turret mounts with high-speed gun movement to improve aim at the target. Because of this, in the early 20th century, rapid-fire guns were placed on cruisers, as a rule, right on the deck or in casemates, which limited their firing range and did not ensure their reliable operation in difficult weather conditions.\\n\\nCommissioning of Omaha-class cruisers in 1923–1925 marked a gradual transition to the deployment of all main battery guns on cruisers in turret mounts.","IDS_PCZC191_AA_152MM_3BARREL":"152 mm Triple Turret","IDS_PCZC191_AA_152MM_3BARREL_DESCRIPTION":"The main drawback of American 152 mm guns of the 1900s–1920s was their relatively small shell weight, 48 kg, whereas almost all similar-caliber artillery systems of other countries used shells heavier than 50 kg. In 1932, for the new generation of light cruisers, the Mark 16 gun was developed. It was designed for a \\\"super-heavy\\\" shell weighing 59 kg, significantly superior to its counterparts in destructive power. A triple turret with a high degree of automation of the loading process was created especially for these guns, which ensured a phenomenal firing rate for those times—up to 10 shots per minute.\\n\\nSuch main battery mounts were used on Brooklyn- and Helena-class cruisers, and their slightly modified version was deployed on Cleveland- and Fargo-class cruisers. A relatively small initial velocity of heavy shell and close location of the barrels in the turret had an adverse effect on the firing accuracy over long distances. However, the turret's ability to shoot up to 30 shells per minute made it an extremely formidable weapon in close- and medium-ranged battles. This advantage was especially useful in the fast-flowing night battles between American and Japanese ships during the Pacific Campaign.","IDS_PCZC192_AA_152MM_UNIVERSAL":"152 mm Dual-Purpose Mount","IDS_PCZC192_AA_152MM_UNIVERSAL_DESCRIPTION":"The idea of creating a dual-purpose gun with a caliber exceeding 127 mm arose in the U.S. Navy back in 1937, but it was not cast in metal until 1948, when cruiser Worcester was completed. As the main battery turrets, ships of this class used the same 152 mm Mark 16 guns as on Brooklyn- and Cleveland-class cruisers, which had the same theoretical firing range, around 23.8 km, and the same shell weight, about 59 kg. The fundamental distinction of the new mounts was their greater automation of the loading mechanisms and significantly increased capacity of the horizontal and vertical power drives.\\n\\nThe dual-purpose 152 mm turrets of Worcester-class cruisers became the world's first mounts of such a large caliber that were able to fire effectively at air targets. Their rotation speed was up to 25 degrees per second with the ability to shoot about 12 shells per minute from each barrel. Such impressive features came at the cost of the mount's relatively large size and the immense weight of the turrets highly charged with mechanisms. The dual-purpose 152 mm twin mount weighed approximately 20% more than the 152 mm triple turret of cruiser Cleveland or Helena, which defined the USS Worcester's displacement, quite solid for a ship of this type.","IDS_PCZC193_AA_152MM_UNIVERSAL_MARK32":"127 mm Mark 29 Dual-Purpose Mount","IDS_PCZC193_AA_152MM_UNIVERSAL_MARK32_DESCRIPTION":"Developed in the United States by 1932, the 127 mm Mark 12 gun became the basis of the most numerous dual-purpose artillery system that existed in a multitude of variants and was mounted almost on every major U.S. Navy warship in the period from 1934 to 1945.\\n\\nThe first dual-purpose twin turrets with Mark 12 guns appeared in 1939. They were designated as Mark 29 and mounted on light cruisers Helena and St. Louis to provide them with long-range AA defense capabilities and, as an addition to the main 152 mm battery, to attack other ships and onshore targets. Atlanta-class cruisers which had 6 to 8 such turrets became the world's first ships of this type with dual-purpose mounts as their main battery.\\n\\nMark 29 was a highly efficient artillery system. A heavy-duty power drive and reliable mechanisms ensured a horizontal aiming speed of 25 degrees per second, and a vertical aiming speed of 15 degrees per second. The turret guns had a nominal rate of fire of 15 shots per minute, but that could be increased for a short period of time, shooting up to 22 shells—each weighing about 25 kg—per minute.\\n\\nThe basis for dual-purpose artillery on the subsequent classes of American cruisers—Cleveland, Baltimore and Des Moines—was a slightly modified Mark 32 mount.","IDS_PCZC194_AA_76MM_ANTIAIRCRAFT":"76 mm Mark 10 AA Gun","IDS_PCZC194_AA_76MM_ANTIAIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION":"One of the first AA guns of the U.S. Navy, the Mark 10 with a caliber of 76 mm, was developed in 1913–1915 on the basis of an earlier system, the Mark 6, widely used as a secondary battery on U.S. ships built in the 1900s. The Mark 10 gun could fire at elevation angles of up to 85 degrees. Formally, it had a dual purpose, as it could theoretically attack both air and surface targets. However, the Mark 10 was not sufficiently effective in either. In the first case, because it had only manual aiming, in the second case, because the shells were too light.\\n\\nUntil the late 1920s, 76 mm Mark 10 guns were almost the sole AA artillery systems mounted on large warships of the U.S. Navy. New York-class battleships were among the first to receive them during rearmament in 1916.\\n\\nMark 10 mounts, two per ship, were already included in the design of Omaha-class light cruisers, which began to enter service in 1923.","IDS_PCZC195_AA_12_7MM_ANTIAIRCRAFT":"12.7 mm M2 Browning AA Machine Gun","IDS_PCZC195_AA_12_7MM_ANTIAIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION":"The M2 Browning machine gun was developed in the United States in 1932, and since then has been very extensively used in all types of the country's armed forces. Its anti-aircraft version appeared in the Navy the following year. The machine gun's rate of fire was quite high, about 500 shots per minute, but rapid development of military aviation in the 1930s prevented 12.7 mm machine guns from being effective when firing at high-speed air targets.\\n\\nUntil the late 1930s, when 28 mm AA guns were created, there was no short-range AA defense system in the U.S. Navy that could serve as an alternative to the M2 Browning. As a result, 12.7 mm machine guns could be found on nearly all American cruisers until 1941.\\n\\nOnly in 1942, with deployment of the mass production of Oerlikon AA guns, obsolete Brownings disappeared from large U.S. warships.","IDS_PCZC196_AA_28MM_ANTIAIRCRAFT":"28 mm Automatic AA Mount","IDS_PCZC196_AA_28MM_ANTIAIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION":"Development of the first American automatic AA defense system began in 1929 and was completed by 1934, when the resultant quadruple 28 mm mount could be brought into production. However, the tests revealed numerous deficiencies in the system. It took several years to eliminate them, so the new weapons were only delivered to the Navy in 1940.\\n\\nThe automatic 28 mm mount had a rate of fire of up to 150 shots per minute and was the first U.S. Navy AA defense system with power drive. Because of its low reliability, the 28 mm mount very quickly got its rather disrespectful nickname, Chicago Piano.\\n\\nSince the production rates of these systems could not meet the ever growing requirements of the Navy, they were never widely deployed on large warships. In 1942, after the beginning of mass production of 40 mm Bofors AA guns that considerably exceeded the Chicago Piano in their effective firing range, reliability, and power, the 28 mm guns were taken out of production.","IDS_PCZC197_AA_20MM_ANTIAIRCRAFT":"20 mm Oerlikon Automatic AA Mount","IDS_PCZC197_AA_20MM_ANTIAIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION":"At the core of the Oerlikon, the most widespread AA defense gun of World War II, was the design of a 20 mm German gun developed by Reinhold Becker in 1913–1915. The Becker gun, which had a high rate of fire and light weight for its time, was intended for mounting on airplanes and the legendary Zeppelins. From Germany, demilitarized after World War I, the production of the 20 mm gun was moved to the Swiss company SEMAG, and then, after its collapse, to Oerlikon.\\n\\nInitially, the Swiss version of the 20 mm gun did not have any impressive characteristics. In 1935, the U.S.A., having purchased samples of the gun for testing, refused to use Oerlikons, which put the Swiss company on the brink of bankruptcy. Ironically, Oerlikon managed to continue working on improvements to the gun's design thanks to Japan which purchased a license for production of the 20 mm guns. Japanese Oerlikons, designated as Type 99, became the basis for the armament of the famous Zero fighter aircraft.\\n\\nIn 1940, during the war, the United States began looking for a replacement for the obsolete and weak Browning AA machine guns. The 20 mm automatic Oerlikon, significantly improved by that time, proved to be very useful. In 1941, its production was deployed in the U.S.A., and soon the Oerlikons were mounted on almost every warship, from boats to battleships.","IDS_PCZC198_AA_40MM_ANTIAIRCRAFT":"40 mm Bofors Automatic AA Mount","IDS_PCZC198_AA_40MM_ANTIAIRCRAFT_DESCRIPTION":"Reliability, a high rate of fire (up to 120 shots per minute), considerable height of engagement (over 6 km), destructive force of the shells (projectile weight of 900 g)—this all made the 40 mm automatic gun, developed by the Swedish company Bofors in 1930–1933, the most widespread AA artillery system. In the 1940s–1950s, it was used by dozens of countries around the world.\\n\\nProduction of the 40 mm Bofors in the United States began in 1941, but the Swedish gun did not satisfy the Navy in many respects, so the Americans introduced many improvements in the mount's design using, among other things, the British version of the Bofors. The mass production of the 40 mm guns was deployed only at the end of 1942, yet they managed to satisfy the Navy's requirements in full only by 1944, when Bofors was able to finally replace the ineffective 28 mm Chicago Pianos on ships.\\n\\nThe Bofors was produced in a variety of versions: with air and water cooling, in twin, quadruple, and single mounts, with manual aiming and with a power drive. A little more than ten thousand mounts were manufactured for the Navy and Coast Guard, over twenty thousand for the army, and around nine thousand were supplied to allied countries.","IDS_PCZC199_AA_76MM_ANTIAIRCRAFT_MARK33":"76 mm Mark 33 AA Mount","IDS_PCZC199_AA_76MM_ANTIAIRCRAFT_MARK33_DESCRIPTION":"At the final stage of the war in the Pacific Ocean, the U.S. Navy had to face the Japanese tactics of kamikaze pilots.

Only after the war was the most efficient 76 mm AA gun developed—the twin Mark 33. This weapon which had a very high aiming speed (24 degrees per second horizontally, 30 degrees per second vertically), the ability to fire up to 50 shells per minute from each barrel, exhaustive destructive force of the projectile, with a maximum engagement of over 9 km in height, crowned the development of American AA defense systems in the 1940s.\\n\\nOne of the first to receive Mark 33 mounts was light cruiser Worcester, commissioned in 1948.

As a comparison, a similar decoration for the U.S. Army was introduced only in 1941. The design of the Navy medal has changed several times. In 1885, the third version of its appearance was approved, and it remained unchanged until 1961.\\n\\nThe medal is received by Navy military personnel inferior to the officer's rank.

The functions of the Turret Captain—who ranked next to the Turret Commander—was to ensure fail-safe operation of the gun mount, to instruct the turret personnel, and to monitor how servicemen performed their duties.\\n\\nThe Turret Captain's patch remained nearly unchanged since 1904. It was worn on the right sleeve and was abolished in 1949 together with the rating, becoming merged with the rating of the Gunner's Mate.","IDS_PCZC213_AA_GUNNER":"Gunner's Mate","IDS_PCZC213_AA_GUNNER_DESCRIPTION":"The rating of Gunner—or Gunner's Mate—is one of the oldest in the U.S. Navy. It appeared at the end of the 18th century, nearly simultaneously with the birth of the American fleet itself.\\n\\nGunners are not only those who service the weapons during the battle; the rating also includes members of a team servicing shell magazines and gunpowder magazines, those who keep all artillery-related mechanisms in a serviceable condition, and those responsible for the ship's small arms storage. Until 1941, this rating also included gun fire control system maintenance personnel.\\n\\nThe sleeve insignia of a Gunner's Mate was introduced in the 1860s and initially depicted two crossed gun barrels. The decoration acquired its design which resembles its modern look after the 1894 sleeve insignia reform.

The intensive development of gun fire control systems in the 1920s–1930s resulted in a significant increase in the relevant service personnel. Eventually, in 1941, the U.S. Navy reassigned a specific group of Gunners to Gun Fire Control System Operators—Fire Controlmen.\\n\\nTheir duties included rendering assistance to the Artillery Officers by operating optical range finders and ballistic calculators, as well as the maintenance and servicing of these devices.\\n\\nThe sleeve emblem of Fire Controlmen contained the image of a range finder. Until 1949, the patch was worn on the right sleeve, after that, on the left sleeve. In 1948, a special rating of Fire Control Technician was singled out, while the rating of the Fire Controlman was eliminated in 1957.","IDS_PCZC215_AA_TORPEDO_MAN":"Torpedoman","IDS_PCZC215_AA_TORPEDO_MAN_DESCRIPTION":"A separate rating of Torpedoman (since 1942, Torpedoman's Mate) was created in the U.S. Navy only in 1921, although ships armed with torpedo tubes had already been part of the fleet for three decades by that time.\\n\\nTorpedomen were responsible for servicing torpedo tubes, their aiming at the target, and launching.\\n\\nTorpedomen's sleeve was introduced simultaneously with the establishment of the rating in 1921 and was abolished in 2007, when the rating of Torpedoman's Mate was combined with the rating of Gunner's Mate. Until 1949, the patch was worn on the right sleeve, since 1949, it has been worn on the left sleeve.","IDS_PCZC216_AA_AVIATION_PILOT":"Aviation Pilot","IDS_PCZC216_AA_AVIATION_PILOT_DESCRIPTION":"The rating of Aviation Pilot existed in the U.S. Navy to designate aircraft pilots who did not have an officer's rank, unlike Aviators. This rating was introduced in 1924, during the early days of naval aviation. The Aviation Pilot's sleeve patch had an emblem of the rating, with an image of the naval pilot's sign embroidered with yellow threads, which distinguished them from other naval specialists.\\n\\nIn 1948, the U.S. Navy scrapped the program of non-officer pilot training, and the rating was formally abolished, but it actually ceased to exist only in the early 1980s, when the last sailor who wore the Aviation Pilot's patch left the Navy.","IDS_PCZC217_AA_ORDINANCEMAN":"Aviation Ordnanceman","IDS_PCZC217_AA_ORDINANCEMAN_DESCRIPTION":"Aviation Ordnancemen were designated a specific rating in the Navy in 1926.

The duties of the sailors of this rating included keeping all radar equipment in a serviceable condition, as well as its operation.\\n\\nIn 1972, the Radarman rating was abolished. Initially, ship radars were operated by sailors who specialized as radio operators. Therefore, when the rating of Radarman appeared, their emblem was based on that of radio operators, namely a triplet of lightning bolts crossed by an arrow. The patch was worn on the left sleeve.","IDS_PCZC219_AA_SIGNALMAN":"Signalman","IDS_PCZC219_AA_SIGNALMAN_DESCRIPTION":"Signalers have existed on ships for a long time, since the appearance of the flag semaphore and the system for transmitting messages using signal flags. Over time, the duties of signalers also naturally included observation of the water surface and, later, the situation in the air. Nevertheless, a special rating for signalers (Signalman) appeared in the U.S. Navy only in 1921.\\n\\nThe sleeve patch of a Signalman depicted two crossed semaphore flags and, until 1949, it was worn on the right sleeve. In 1948–1949, the rating was merged with the navigation rating (Quartermaster). In 1956, it was restored (with the patch worn on the left sleeve), and in 2003, it was finally abolished.","IDS_PCZC220_AA_MACHINIST":"Machinist's Mate","IDS_PCZC220_AA_MACHINIST_DESCRIPTION":"The rating of Machinist appeared on U.S. Navy ships in the 1860s, after the fleet's transition to steam traction. Having undergone a number of changes in its early history, the rating's final structure and name (Machinist's Mate) was adopted in 1904, after another revision of the rating system. The duty of Machinist's Mates included ensuring proper operation of engine room units, all other engines, and support systems located on the ship, including the water supply, cooling systems, fuel supply, and others.\\n\\nSince 1886, the emblem of Machinist's Mates has been the image of a ship's three-bladed propeller.

The closest assistants to Navigational Officers and Officers of the Deck, they operate navigational instruments, work with maps, and stand at the helm.\\n\\nThis rating is one of the oldest in the U.S. Navy, founded in the late 18th century. A special sleeve sign of navigating sailors appeared in the 1860s.\\n\\nSince 1886, the emblem of the rating has been a steering wheel (the helm). The insignia generally resembling its modern look acquired its appearance in 1894. The patch was worn on the left sleeve, except for the period from 1913 to 1949, when it was worn on the right sleeve.","IDS_PCZC222_AA_STOREKEEPER":"Storekeeper","IDS_PCZC222_AA_STOREKEEPER_DESCRIPTION":"The rating of a supply handler or stockman (Storekeeper) in the U.S. Navy existed from 1916 to 2009.

She was commissioned a little more than 12 months later, in June 1917. Valkyrie was the lead ship in a series of flotilla leaders of the V class (5 items). These ships represented a breakthrough for their time, and defined the general appearance of destroyers not only in the British Navy, but also across the other leading navies of the world for a long time to come. Their large dimensions resulted in sea-keeping characteristics and sea endurance good enough to operate conjointly with battle squadrons. Another progressive solution was the placement of artillery guns in super-firing turrets, which later became a standard scheme for subsequent generations of destroyers.\\n\\nFollowing HMS Valkyrie and her sister ships, several further series of ships were built resembling her, in regard to arrangement and characteristics. From 1917 through 1924, a total of 67 ships were commissioned, collectively designated as V-class and W-class destroyers. Many of them remained in service until 1945, thus participating in World War I as well as being on active duty during the whole of World War II. Initially, HMS Valkyrie was a member of Harwich Force, whose main mission was carrying out escort operations in coastal waters. Later on, she would become a part of the Grand Fleet, the major British naval force. In 1936, the ship was scrapped for metal.","IDS_PCZC253_HMSICARUS":"HMS Icarus","IDS_PCZC253_HMSICARUS_DESCRIPTION":"Commissioned in May 1937, HMS Icarus was the fourth ship in the history of the Royal Navy to be named after Icarus, a heroic figure from ancient Greek myths. This ship belonged to the I class—the last series of so-called \\\"standard\\\" destroyers. This designation was given to a large group of ships of this type that were built in the U.K. between 1924 and 1938. They shared a \\\"standard\\\" arrangement, mainly inherited from the V and W classes, with water displacement of around 1,300 tons, a speed of around 35–37 knots, and armament consisting of four 120 mm guns and two 533 mm torpedo tubes. Initially, in 1936, the British Navy ordered eight I-class destroyers that were supposed to form one flotilla. It's worth mentioning though that their flotilla leader was built as part of a separate project. Some time later, by the order of the Turkish Navy, four more ships carrying less powerful torpedo armament were built, two of which were inducted into the Royal Navy during World War II.\\n\\nThe operational record of HMS Icarus was extremely intense. In April 1940, the destroyer took part in the Norwegian Campaign, capturing a German transport ship and playing her role in the Second Battle of Narvik, a glorious event for the Royal Navy. Soon after, HMS Icarus was involved in the evacuation of Dunkirk. In May 1941, she made an appearance in the well-known Hunt for Bismarck. In the summer of 1944, the destroyer covered the landing operation in Normandy. Besides these roles, throughout the entire war, HMS Icarus participated in a range of convoy operations in the Atlantic Ocean, Arctic Region, and Mediterranean during which time she added four sunk German submarines to her combat record. In 1946, the merited warship was decommissioned from the navy.","IDS_PCZC254_HMSJUTLAND":"HMS Jutland","IDS_PCZC254_HMSJUTLAND_DESCRIPTION":"The first warship in the Royal Navy to be named after the Battle of Jutland was a Battle-class destroyer that began her active duty in 1947, and received a badge depicting a Sea Griffin. The new destroyers, built in several series and named after significant British victories on land and at sea, were the Admiralty's response to the threat of air attacks, which had drastically increased by that time. From 1942 through 1945, a total of 40 ships were laid down, with the construction of two more destroyers for the Royal Australian Navy starting in 1946. At the end of World War II, the Battle-class destroyers were no longer needed in such great numbers, resulting in the completion of only 26 ships of this class.\\n\\nHMS Jutland and her sister ships conceptually differed from the destroyers of the preceding class in that they were armed with up-to-date and fully-fledged dual-purpose main battery artillery, comprising four or five 113 mm guns. Thanks to the mass production of Bofors and Oerlikon mounts set up in Britain and the U.S., all small-caliber anti-aircraft artillery of Battle-class destroyers consisted of these mounts, which noticeably out-matched the British Pom-Pom's and 12.7 mm machine guns in terms of performance characteristics. However, these ships had just a few occasions to use their powerful AA defenses in practice. Only one destroyer from this series, HMS Barfleur, managed to see action during World War II as a member of the British Pacific Fleet. HMS Jutland did her military service in peacetime and finished it in 1965.","IDS_PCZC255_HMSDARING":"HMS Daring","IDS_PCZC255_HMSDARING_DESCRIPTION":"The Royal Navy giving the name Daring to its warships was a tradition dating back to the early 19th century. The sixth ship to bear this name was a destroyer. Laid down in September 1945, HMS Daring and her sister ships were the pinnacle of development of this ship type in Britain, being the largest and most powerful destroyers ever to serve in the navies of the British Commonwealth. Their characteristic feature, in addition to powerful anti-submarine armament, was anti-aircraft artillery whose gun fire control system, together with the main battery's automatic aiming system, which allowed them to simultaneously fire at two targets within the short- and long-range zones of the ship's AA defenses.\\n\\nThe superiority of the new ships over the other representatives of this ship type was so great that from 1953 to 1957 they were not officially classified as destroyers, but were instead referred to as \\\"Darings\\\"—taking the name of the lead ship of the series. Eight ships of this class were inducted into the Royal Navy in the period spanning 1952–1954. Later, four more of these ships were laid down for the Royal Australian Navy, but only three of them would be completed. HMS Daring, the lead ship of the class, served in the Royal Navy from 1952 to 1971.","IDS_PCZC256_120MMMARK9":"120 mm gun Mark IX","IDS_PCZC256_120MMMARK9_DESCRIPTION":"The Mark IX gun was designed in the late 1920s to replace outdated systems of the same caliber that had been in use since World War I. The new gun had twice the rate of fire and was capable of firing up to 12 shells per minute, with each projectile weighing 22 kg. The elevation angle of the first mounts was 30 degrees, which later was increased to 40, and then further to 55 degrees. The maximum range of fire at the elevation of 30 degrees was about 14.5 km.\\n\\nMost destroyers built in Britain between 1930 and 1940 were armed with the Mark IX gun model for their main battery artillery. All so-called \\\"standard\\\" destroyers starting from the A class, up to the I class, as well as several series of ships of from the time of war, carried four single-mounts each. The J-, K-, N-, and Tribal-class destroyers were equipped with the same guns, but placed in twin-mounts. Fast-firing and quite powerful Mark IX guns were well-suited to hit-and-run battles at short- and mid-range, which is why British sailors valued them so much. The major drawback of this system, that prominently manifested itself in the very first months of World War II, was its inability to effectively fire at airborne targets. The poor ability of the Mark IX to repel the attacks of the Luftwaffe's dive bombers, the nemeses of British destroyers, forced the British Admiralty to focus on the development of dual-purpose guns.","IDS_PCZC257_40MMPOMPOM":"40 mm AA Pom-Pom Mount","IDS_PCZC257_40MMPOMPOM_DESCRIPTION":"The best-known British anti-aircraft gun appeared during World War I. It was designed by the Vickers company and went into service from 1915 under the designation \\\"2-pounder Mark II gun\\\". The gun was nicknamed the pom-pom because of the characteristic sound it produced when firing. Mark II guns were almost solely produced as single-mounts with manual aiming. Some of the initial pom-pom guns would also be used during World War II, mostly on mobilized civil vessels.\\n\\nThe early 1920s saw the start of development of a 40 mm multi-barreled AA gun with a power drive. Due to poor funding, typical of the British Admiralty in the 1920s, the process of accepting the new gun into service was a very long one. Only in the early 1930s did the navy start to receive the first 40 mm AA Mark VIII guns, initially placed in octuple mounts. The new gun had the same barrel as the Mark II, which is why it inherited the pom-pom nickname. In 1935, a quadruple mount was designed which would become the basis for the AA armament of British destroyers starting from the Tribal class. The 2-pounder's rate of fire was around 100 shots per minute with its effective vertical range of fire being just a little above 1 km and the shell weighing a little over 900 grams. The pom-pom gun was inferior in terms of almost all performance characteristics in comparison to Bofors AA automatic guns of the same caliber. The latter though were under-produced, which is why they never superseded the presence of pom-pom guns on British ships.","IDS_PCZC258_127MMVIKKERS":"12.7 mm Vickers AA Machine Gun","IDS_PCZC258_127MMVIKKERS_DESCRIPTION":"The Vickers company developed the 12.7 mm AA machine gun in the mid-1920s. However, it wasn't until 1932 that it entered into service in the Royal Navy. Since the navy did not have any other small caliber AA systems at that time, the Vickers guns became very widespread. In the 1930s and early 1940s, it was present on virtually all ships of the Royal Navy, from battleships to minesweepers.\\n\\nThe Vickers quadruple mount was the most popular of its kind in the navy. It had to be aimed manually, with a practicable rate of fire of around 150–200 shots per minute, and an effective vertical range of fire a bit higher than 700 m. By the mid-1930s, the 12.7 mm machine gun was considered to be ineffective against up-to-date combat aircraft of that time. However, the British Navy would have no alternative to this weapon until the massive shipments of 20 mm Oerlikon automatic guns commenced. In particular, the quadruple 12.7 mm Vickers machine guns formed the basis of the AA defenses of British \\\"standard\\\" destroyers, starting from the D class.","IDS_PCZC259_113MMMARK5":"113 mm Mark VI Dual-Purpose Mount","IDS_PCZC259_113MMMARK5_DESCRIPTION":"Designed at the end of World War II, the 4.5 inch Mark VI mount (113 mm) would become the most advanced British dual-purpose artillery system of its time. The elevation angle of its guns, placed in turrets, was 80 degrees, the range of fire at surface targets was 19 km, and the effective vertical range of fire exceeded 12 km. The 25 kg shell of the new 113 mm gun was heavier than the projectile of the \\\"standard\\\" 120 mm Mark IX gun. The essential advantages of the new mount were its ability to automatically aim at targets and its mechanized supply of ammunition, which enhanced its rate of fire to 24 shots per minute.\\n\\nTwo Battle-class destroyers of the Royal Australian Navy, commissioned between 1950 and 1951, were the first to carry these new dual-purpose turrets. The first British ship to receive Mark VI guns as their main battery artillery was HMS Daring, commissioned into the Royal Navy in 1952. The last ships of the British Navy armed with these guns were decommissioned in the 1980s. The navies of some countries still have these guns in their arsenal.","IDS_PCZC260_NARVIK1940":"Second Battle of Narvik, April 1940","IDS_PCZC260_NARVIK1940_DESCRIPTION":"After the seizure of the Norwegian port of Narvik on April 9, 1940, ten German destroyers were forced to linger in the waters of Ofotfjord due to a lack of fuel. The next morning, five British destroyers stormed Narvik harbor and, before the enemy knew what was happening, sank two German destroyers and damaged several others. While \\\"ousting\\\" the British, who eventually lost two of their ships, the German destroyers exhausted their supply of shells. In addition to their shortage of fuel, they stood no chance of breaking through.\\n\\nShortly after noon on April 13, an impressive sight could be seen from the snow-covered shores of Ofotfjord: battleship Warspite, accompanied by nine destroyers, including HMS Cossack and HMS Icarus, rumbling with her guns was surfing the mirror-like northern waters. Their opponents were doomed... Eventually, over the course of a few days, half of all available Kriegsmarine destroyers were sunk, hailing a great victory for the Royal Navy.","IDS_PCZC261_DUNKIRK1940":"Dunkirk Evacuation, May 1940","IDS_PCZC261_DUNKIRK1940_DESCRIPTION":"The success of a military operation is not always determined by the number of enemy ships sunk or enemy soldiers captured. The allied victory at Dunkirk from the end of May to the beginning of June, 1940, was defined by the 300,000 lives of British and French soldiers that were saved. This operation preserved the lives and freedom of trained military personnel, enabling them to continue their fight in the war. With the cost of the operation being a number of ships and small vessels sunk, the quick decisions made by the navy, improvising at every turn, and the incredible dedication shown by British sailors, soldiers, and civilians, worked miracles in those days.\\n\\nNearly forty of the Royal Navy destroyers that participated in Operation Dynamo accounted for around a third of all evacuees. Initially, the warships assembled for the operation only intended to cover the boarding of the evacuated soldiers onto civilian ships. However, it would have been nearly impossible to save as many if the original plan was stuck to. So, on the night of May 28, by the light of the fires raging in the city tormented by the Luftwaffe, HMS Wakeful and HMS Gallant were the first to enter Dunkirk's harbor and board soldiers directly from the embankments, while other destroyers joined the evacuation from nearby beaches. On the morning of May 29, during another round of evacuation, Wakeful, loaded with hundreds of soldiers, was sunk by a German submarine. On the same day, Gallant, having survived an air raid, hit a mine and could not continue her part in the operation.","IDS_PCZC262_TARIGO1941":"Tarigo Convoy Rout, April 1941","IDS_PCZC262_TARIGO1941_DESCRIPTION":"One of the most difficult theaters of combat for the Royal Navy was the Mediterranean. The battle chronicles continuously reported both heavy defeats and impressive victories. One such victory which occurred off the Kerkennah Islands was the rout of an Italian-German convoy en route to North Africa, carrying reinforcements for General Rommel. This convoy would persevere in the history books under the name of Tarigo, after the Italian destroyer that was the escort's flagship.\\n\\nOn April 15, 1941, British aviation reconnaissance discovered several enemy transport ships heading southward, accompanied by three destroyers. The interception of the convoy from Malta was assigned to Force \\\"K\\\", which included two J-class and two Tribal-class destroyers. The Force was led by Captain (D) Philip Mack, holding his pennant on board HMS Jervis. In the early hours of April 16, British destroyers literally descended upon the unsuspecting convoy, quickly turning the fight into a battle at pistol-shot distance. Three Italian destroyers from the escort resisted the fierce attack, but they could do very little against the twenty-eight 120 mm British guns. At the cost of losing one ship, receiving a torpedo hit at close range, Force K sent the entire convoy—three destroyers and five transport ships—to the bottom of the sea, depriving General Rommel of 1,700 soldiers and several thousand tons of cargo that would have been incredibly valuable to him.","IDS_PCZC263_HMSMEDEA1916":"HMS Medea in the Dover Patrol, April 1916","IDS_PCZC263_HMSMEDEA1916_DESCRIPTION":"Destroyer Kriti was built in the U.K. as part of a special project, close to the Admiralty M-class, and joined the Greek Navy in her early days of service. With the outbreak of World War I, the ship would be repurchased by the U.K. and, with a truly elegant British sense of humor, named Medea, in honor of the character from Greek mythology closely associated with Crete. Medea and her sister ships differed from the other destroyers of the Royal Navy by their original silhouettes with high fore-funnels.\\n\\nHaving come into operation in May 1915, HMS Medea joined the famous Harwich Striking Force, operating in the waters south of the British Isles. On April 24, 1916, the destroyer took part in an operation to block the German Navy's Flanders U-boat flotilla. In the heat of battle and in an attempt to cover her damaged sister ship, Medea, under fire from the enemy's coastal batteries, lanced at three German destroyers and routed them out.","IDS_PCZC264_CAMO1940":"Camouflage for Coastal Operations, 1940","IDS_PCZC264_CAMO1940_DESCRIPTION":"During the initial months of World War II, most of the British Navy continued to operate with peacetime colors: dark gray or light gray, depending on the theater of action. However, solid coloring did not suit close inshore operations, and soon some of the ships of the Home Fleet came to boast a variety of two- or three-color disruptive camouflage patterns.\\n\\nThe first camouflage schemes that were used by the Royal Navy during the war were unofficial. The camouflage was applied to the ship's hull by order of her Commander or by the order of the Captain's immediate superiors—Commanders of small units, of destroyer flotillas, etc. The crews used only colors that were immediately available. Clearly, the one most readily available was protective (\\\"khaki\\\") or black paint that was applied in spots on top of the standard gray. Such was the pattern of, for example, G-class destroyer HMS Grenade, that was involved in the Dunkirk evacuation. The extended, official palette of colors that had a special encoding and was designed for the concealment of ships, appeared only in 1941.","IDS_PCZC265_CAMO19401942":"Mediterranean Camouflage, 1940–1942","IDS_PCZC265_CAMO19401942_DESCRIPTION":"The ships of the Home Fleet, often operating in coastal waters, carried mainly disparate concealing camouflages of three or more colors in the initial months of World War II. At the same time, a simpler, two-color pattern became widespread across the Mediterranean fleet. The goal was not to conceal the ship, which would be quite challenging in regular clashes with the Italians in the open sea, but to disorient the enemy in respect of the perceived distance to target. \\n\\nThis camouflage pattern, characteristic for destroyers of the Mediterranean fleet in particular, was obtained by applying large broken stripes and black or dark gray spots (MS1, then G5) on the light gray hull of the ship (507c or MS4a, in accordance with the coding of shades adopted by the Admiralty). The black-and-gray camouflage was most prevalent between 1940 and 1941, but it was used later also.","IDS_PCZC266_CAMO1942":"Admiralty Light Camouflage, 1942","IDS_PCZC266_CAMO1942_DESCRIPTION":"Between 1941 and 1942, British destroyers operating in the Atlantic and Northern waters obtained the so-called Admiralty Light Disruptive type camouflage. This scheme had round-shaped spots of different colors, usually combining shades of gray, green, and blue, in particular MS2 and MS3, applied to the light gray hull and superstructures (official shade code—MS4a). Some areas of the hull were painted dark gray (MS1).\\n\\nThe silhouette of a ship using such a light disruptive scheme, under certain visibility conditions, was completely indistinguishable. However, it was not easy to preserve the multicolor paintwork with an individual pattern on the ship. As a result, camouflage patterns in the British Navy were developed along the path of further unification and simplification of colors and patterns used.","IDS_PCZC267_CAMO19431944":"Home Fleet Destroyers Camouflage, 1943–1944","IDS_PCZC267_CAMO19431944_DESCRIPTION":"At the end of 1942, a single camouflage scheme was adopted for destroyers entering service under wartime emergency shipbuilding programs. In accordance with the pattern, the main part of the hull and superstructure of the ship was painted white or a similar color. In certain places, wedges of darker shades with more or less the same outlines were applied. Besides this, about two-thirds of the hull's length, starting from the stern, had a strip, usually of a darker color.\\n\\nThis camouflage scheme used standardized colors of several shades of gray, blue, or green. Gradually, in 1943–1944, other destroyers of the Home Fleet, including those that were part of the Royal Canadian Fleet, received the same coloring pattern. A distinctive feature of HMCS Haida and HMCS Huron, painted in accordance with this scheme, was the presence of three oblique white stripes on their sides.","IDS_PCZC268_NY2019_PRINZEITELFRIEDRICHEMBLEM":"Prinz Eitel Friedrich","IDS_PCZC268_NY2019_PRINZEITELFRIEDRICHEMBLEM_DESCRIPTION":"Wilhelm Eitel Friedrich Christian Karl, the second son of Prussian Prince Wilhelm, the future Emperor of Germany, was born in 1883 at the Marble Palace in Potsdam. After graduating from the University of Bonn in 1904, Prince Eitel Friedrich decided to pursue a military career by enrolling in the foot guard regiment. At the very beginning of World War I, he was appointed as Commander of his regiment. As a member of the guard's infantry, the Prince fought on both Western and Eastern fronts before being wounded in action. For his honor in battle, Eitel Friedrich received the Iron Cross of the first and second classes, as well as the highest German award, the Order of Pour le Mérite (French for \\\"For Merits\\\"), with oak leaves.\\nAn ocean liner built in 1904 was named after Prince Eitel Friedrich. When World War I broke out, the liner was converted into an auxiliary cruiser. In August 1914, by the order of Vice-Admiral von Spee, the Commander of the East Asian squadron, Prinz Eitel Friedrich, embarked on a solo raid lasting seven months in the waters of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. In March 1915, the raider, having exhausted all possibilities to replenish her supplies, was interned in the USA.

Famous pirates and naval commanders, including John Hawkins, Walter Raleigh, and Francis Drake, with the support of the Queen, depleted the resources of the main maritime power of the time – Spain. In 1588, the British Navy, under the command of Admirals Howard and Drake, defeated the Invincible Spanish Armada.\\nFrench lilies and English lions have shared the coats of arms of British monarchs since the Hundred Years' War, when the rulers of Albion considered the French throne to be theirs. At the same time, in the middle of the 14th century, the emblem of the newly established Order of the Garter, the highest British order of chivalry, became part of the coat of arms. Elizabeth I chose the English lion and Welsh dragon Y Ddraig Goch, symbolizing her dual titles as Queen of England and Queen of Wales, as the figures supporting the coat of arms.

Fully aware of the importance of the fleet as an integral tool of foreign policy, Emperor Nicholas paid a great deal of attention to the development of the nation's naval forces. Under his rule, the Russian sailing fleet reached the peak of its power and perfection. In 1853, it consisted of over 400 ships of all ranks, including about 40 battleships. It was under Nicholas I that Russia's first steam warship and first warship with a propeller engine were built.\\nIn the year of the Emperor's death, a sailing battleship named after him was laid down in St. Petersburg. After being commissioned in 1861, she had a steam engine mounted. More than three decades later, in 1893, the most up-to-date battleship of the Russian Navy, Imperator Nikolai I, visited New York City to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America. During World War I, the same name was carried by a seaplane carrier, a battle unit of the Black Sea Fleet that had been converted from a cargo-and-passenger vessel.

He made three voyages around the world in his lifetime, becoming the first man to climb the second highest peak of Canada and the USA, Mount St. Elias, aged 24. When he was 26, he led an expedition to the North Pole, during which he reached Franz Joseph Land, but was forced to return because of severe frostbite. In 1906, Luigi Amedeo was the first to conquer the highest summit (over 5,000 m) of the Rwenzori massif in Equatorial Africa. Three years later, in the course of an expedition to conquer the second highest peak of the world, K2 or Chogori, he set a world record by climbing to a height of 6,250 m.\\nAs the Vice-Admiral of the Regia Marina (Italian for Royal Navy) during World War I, Prince Luigi Amedeo led the Italian fleet that fought in the Adriatic Sea. In 1920, he began the project of his lifetime – establishing a settlement in Italian Somalia with the aim of studying and introducing the most up-to-date farming methods. Through the efforts of the prince, who invested his personal funds into the construction of roads, schools, and hospitals, the settlement grew into a small city within a few years. The Duke of Abruzzi's settlement became his fate, where the prince raised a family by marrying a local resident. It was there that he died in 1933.

According to the chronicles, the fleet assembled by the Prince for this purpose consisted of 2,000 ships. The story goes that in order to prevent the Rus people from entering the city, the Golden Horn waterway was blocked by a chain, but Oleg put his ships on wheels and proceeded to Constantinople by land. The stunned Byzantines asked for peace following this.\\nNaming ships of the Russian Imperial Navy in honor of the legendary characters of ancient Russian history and mythology became especially popular in the middle of the 19th century. In 1860, propeller frigate Oleg was launched in Kronstadt. The next ship that would be named in honor of the conqueror of Constantinople was the Bogatyr-class armored cruiser, laid down in St. Petersburg in 1902. The second Oleg, barely completed in the autumn of 1904 at the height of the war with Japan, was sent to the Far East as a member of the notorious 2nd Pacific Squadron. Having avoided sinking in the Battle of Tsushima, the cruiser returned to the Baltic after the war. During World War I, she participated in covering minelaying operations and carried out raids on enemy communications facilities. After the collapse of the Russian Empire, Oleg became part of the Naval Forces of the 'Workers and Peasants' Red Army.

These relatively cheap cruisers were built mostly by order of countries that wanted to have their own navies but were extremely limited in resources.\\nIn 1895, Armstrong received an order from Brazil to build three armored cruisers with a displacement of about 3,500 tons, and main armament of rapid-fire 152 mm guns. However, the customer's finances quickly ran low, which resulted in the Brazilian Navy receiving only one ship of this class, named the Almirante Barroso. The lead cruiser of the series was bought by Chile, while the third and the fourth ones – the latter being ordered by Brazil instead of the lead ship – were purchased by the United States, a country that could not be said as being limited in funds. The reason behind it was that, in 1898, at the height of the ships' construction, the Spanish-American war broke out, and the United States government feared that the Elswicks would be acquired by Spain, which needed to replenish its fleet with up-to-date combat units. As a result, from 1898–1900, USS New Orleans and USS Albany raised star-spangled banners and became the last major ships built abroad to become part of the U.S. Navy.","IDS_PCZC281_NY2019_VARYAGCARD":"Varyag, 1901","IDS_PCZC281_NY2019_VARYAGCARD_DESCRIPTION":"On September 24, 1863, the New York estuary welcomed Russian steam corvette Varyag which had arrived all the way from the Baltic Sea.

She was a force to be reckoned with: a displacement of nearly 16,000 tons, Krupp cemented armor, improved turret mount mechanisms that provided a rate of fire unrivaled for its time, and fourteen 152 mm guns capable of firing up to seven 45 kg shells per minute.\\nFrom the very beginning of her construction, Mikasa was destined to be the flagship of the navy. During her trial period, in early 1902, she received an original paint scheme that, became the standard for the Imperial Japanese Navy for a short period of time and was not used in any other Navy of the world. In accordance with this scheme, the ship's side, masts, and funnels were covered with black paint, while superstructures, turret mounts, and lifeboats were painted white. The unique detail that made the Navy flagship instantly recognizable was her three white stripes on each of the funnels. However, Mikasa did not pose in her black-and-white dress for too long. In early 1904, the Russo-Japanese War broke out, becoming the swan song of the entirety of the type of squadron battleships.","IDS_PCZC283_NY2019_GRAVIERECARD":"Jurien de la Gravière, 1903","IDS_PCZC283_NY2019_GRAVIERECARD_DESCRIPTION":"In the 1890s, the concept of oceanic \\\"trade destroyers\\\" – large, high-speed ships with good seakeeping characteristics and an impressive action range – gained popularity in France. However, the initial results of the implementation of this idea in shipbuilding programs were not quite satisfactory. Laid down as ocean raiders, cruisers Châteaurenault and Guichen were too expensive, and poorly armed. It was decided to consider and fix these drawbacks when building the third ship.\\nIn November 1897, a cruiser named after the naval commander, historian, and member of the French Academy – Admiral Jean Pierre Edmond Jurien de La Gravière – was laid down at the naval shipyard in Lorient. The new ship was smaller than her predecessors, but she was almost as fast. She also had much better armament, with eight 165 mm guns in comparison to the two 165 mm and six 139 mm carried by Châteaurenault and Guichen. Extended trials delayed her commissioning, and, as a result, Jurien de la Gravière was completed only in 1903. By this time, the Command of the French Navy (Marine Nationale) completely abandoned construction of large armored cruisers, realizing that at such a high cost, their protection was too weak for a serious squadron battle.","IDS_PCZC284_BRITISHCVARC_NAKAJIMA_B5N2":"Nakajima B5N2 \\\"Kate\\\"","IDS_PCZC284_BRITISHCVARC_NAKAJIMA_B5N2_DESCRIPTION":"The Japanese carrier-based torpedo bomber Nakajima B5N, nicknamed \\\"Kate\\\" by the Americans, caused significant trouble for the Allies in the first year of the war in the Pacific. Developed by Nakajima company designers, it was adopted in 1937. Being equipped with a 1,000 hp engine in 1939, the plane received was designated \\\"B5N2\\\" and, with this modification, became the main torpedo bomber of the Japanese Navy until 1943. In terms of range, speed, and, perhaps most importantly, the reliability of its torpedo weapons, \\\"Kate\\\" was noticeably better than its American counterpart—Devastator.\\n\\nThe \\\"moment of glory\\\" for B5N2 was a raid on the U.S. Navy base at Pearl Harbor in December 1941. The operation involved 144 aircraft of this model, and they acted both as torpedo bombers and as low-level bombers (\\\"Kate\\\" could carry up to 800 kg of bombs instead of a torpedo). Every third torpedo launched by the \\\"Kates\\\" that day found their target, leaving the U.S. Pacific Fleet with barely any battleships. In 1942, the lethal B5N2 kept on sinking Allied ships one by one in nearly every major battle. Gradually, however, the aircraft's shortcomings—weak defensive weapons and the lack of any protection—began to manifest themselves. By the beginning of 1944, the \\\"Kates\\\" had been mostly replaced by more advanced machines, although they still remained in use until the end of the war.","IDS_PCZC285_BRITISHCVARC_DOUGLAS_SBD3":"Douglas SBD3 Dauntless","IDS_PCZC285_BRITISHCVARC_DOUGLAS_SBD3_DESCRIPTION":"The SBD Dauntless dive bomber, produced by Douglas company between 1940 and 1944, became one of the leading characters in the war in the Pacific. The codename of the aircraft, \\\"SBD\\\" (scout-bomber Douglas), was usually decoded by the army wits as Slow But Deadly. Starting with the SBD3 modification, produced since the spring of 1942, Dauntless crews were defended by effective armor, and their weapons became really deadly—four machine guns, including two large-caliber ones, and over 1,000 kg of bomb load. Such aircraft could \\\"dress down\\\" even the famous Japanese Zero fighters.\\n\\nThe first victory of the \\\"slow but deadly\\\" aircraft in the war in the Pacific was a Japanese submarine sunk three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Since then and until the middle of 1944, the Dauntlesses were perhaps the most formidable weapon of the U.S. Navy. Their biggest contribution to the victory of Allied forces happened at the Battle of Midway, where the bombs dropped by the SBDs turned four attack aircraft carriers—the pride of the Imperial Japanese Navy—into burning ruins. The last major battle that saw the participation of these aircraft was the battle in the Philippine Sea in the summer of 1944, the famous \\\"Turkey Shoot\\\", after which the Japanese carrier fleet ceased to pose any threat.","IDS_PCZC286_BRITISHCVARC_GRUMMAN_TBF":"Grumman TBF Avenger","IDS_PCZC286_BRITISHCVARC_GRUMMAN_TBF_DESCRIPTION":"The prototype of the carrier-based torpedo bomber TBF, developed by Grumman company, was first presented to the public on December 7, 1941, on the day of the Pearl Harbor attack. The order to start mass production of the new aircraft, immediately dubbed as the Avenger, followed rather quickly. The plane that came off the assembly lines in the spring of 1942 was large and heavy, but actually this was its main advantage: due to the large volume of its fuel tanks, the aircraft had an unsurpassed action radius. Additionally, its capacious bomb compartment enabled it to carry a 570 mm torpedo or over 900 kg of bombs. Moreover, the torpedo bomber was armed with four machine guns, and the seats for its three crew members were well protected by armor. A powerful 1,900 hp engine ensured that this heavy load reached its destination, and at an excellent speed.\\n\\nSince August 1942, each and every large-scale operation in the Pacific Theater involved Avengers. From autumn of the same year, they took part in the battle for the Atlantic and the Mediterranean as well. Their service record included the landings in North Africa, the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the sinking of battleship Yamato, and the invasions of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Avengers acted both as air-to-water bombers and attack aircraft, as well as strike aircraft raiding enemy onshore positions. Equipped with radar, they proved to be wonderful reconnaissance and anti-submarine defense planes, having sunk dozens of submarines.\\n\\nTheir load capacity, range, and potential for refurbishment ensured that the Avengers had a long career in the armed forces of seven countries of the world. Interestingly, in 1954, they became the first aircraft to enter service in the revived Japanese Naval Forces. In the 1980s, the last Avengers still being used were engaged in extinguishing wildfires in the United States and Canada.","IDS_PCZC287_BRITISHCVARC_JUNKERSJU_87C":"Junkers Ju-87C","IDS_PCZC287_BRITISHCVARC_JUNKERSJU_87C_DESCRIPTION":"In 1938, at the height of the construction of Kriegsmarine's first aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelin, it was decided to include dive bombers in her air group. As a matter of urgency, a deck modification of the famous Ju-87 \\\"Stuka\\\", designated by the letter \\\"C\\\" for \\\"Cäsar\\\" (German for Caesar), was developed. The new aircraft differed from the ground-launched dive bomber with its folding wings, a landing hook, and additional equipment that allowed the plane to be set on a catapult. Since the landing gear of Ju-87 was not retracted, the deck version had a mechanism that could \\\"eject\\\" the landing gear in case of ditching. The dive bomber's armament consisted of three small-caliber machine guns and up to 700 kg of bomb load.\\n\\nThe pre-production of Ju-87C began in the summer of 1939. Their crews' training had begun a few months before. However, in the spring of 1940, the construction of Graf Zeppelin was suspended. Some of the Ju-87C were converted back to ground-based aircraft, other were used for experimental purposes until 1944.","IDS_PCZC288_BRITISHCVARC_FAIREY_SWORDFISH":"Fairey Swordfish","IDS_PCZC288_BRITISHCVARC_FAIREY_SWORDFISH_DESCRIPTION":"Without any exaggeration, the Swordfish torpedo bomber can be labeled as the most famous British carrier-based aircraft of the World War II period. Developed in the mid-1930s, the biplane, with its linen trim and open cockpit, was produced until 1944. It participated in hostilities until 1945, leaving an everlasting trace in the history of naval aviation. The Swordfish was developed by Fairey company as a torpedo bomber, reconnaissance plane, and spotting aircraft, with the first machines entering service in 1936. The biplane had rather modest speed characteristics, but at the same time it had a sufficiently large action radius and could carry more than 750 kg of weapons payload.\\n\\nThe Royal Navy actively engaged Swordfishes in the initial period of World War II, despite its extremely archaic design. But this impudence (very British, wouldn't you say?) turned out to be impressively beneficial. On November 12, 1940, in the still of the night, twelve Swordfishes attacked the Italian Navy base in Taranto, wrecking three battleships while losing only two aircraft. With this victory, the British torpedo bombers both changed the course of the war in the Mediterranean and made a strong statement that naval aviation had become an important strategic weapon. In May 1941, a torpedo dropped by a Swordfish made the famous Bismarck face her doom. Subsequently, this easy-to-pilot biplane, with its modest takeoff and landing condition requirements, took its well-deserved place on the decks of the small escort aircraft carriers that accompanied convoys in the Atlantic and Arctic. Equipped with radar and rocket launchers (!), Swordfishes successfully pursued and sank U-boats until 1945.","IDS_PCZC289_BRITISHCVARC_BLACKBURN_SKUA":"Blackburn Skua","IDS_PCZC289_BRITISHCVARC_BLACKBURN_SKUA_DESCRIPTION":"The Skua strike dive bomber was produced by Blackburn company as per the design assignment of a carrier-based, all-metal monoplane, with a closed cockpit and retractable landing gear. For the mid-1930s, the assignment looked very promising, but in the autumn of 1938, when the first aircraft finally began to enter service, the Skua's 900 hp engine was already considered weak and did not provide the new fighters with sufficient speed and maneuverability.\\n\\nArmed with five small-caliber machine guns, the Blackburn Skua could carry one 227 kg bomb and, at the beginning of World War II, performed well as a dive bomber. It could also claim victories in the air as well. For example, the first British aircraft to shoot down an enemy aircraft was a Skua attached to the 803rd squadron of the Naval Air Force based on aircraft carrier Ark Royal. This happened on September 25, 1939, with a German flying boat being its prey. The Skua's most resounding success was the sinking of cruiser Königsberg in the Norwegian port of Bergen in April 1940.","IDS_PCZC290_BRITISHCVARC_WESTLAND_WYVERN":"Westland Wyvern","IDS_PCZC290_BRITISHCVARC_WESTLAND_WYVERN_DESCRIPTION":"The story of the Westland Wyvern, the first turbo-prop warplane, began in 1944. At the height of World War II, the British Navy still had no up-to-date multi-purpose carrier-based aircraft with a large operating radius. The Westland company took up the relevant project and prepared their first prototype in 1946. To provide the pilot with a good overview during takeoff and landing, the plane had a peculiar hump-shaped silhouette. Another feature of the design of a promising strike torpedo bomber, entitled Wyvern, were two four-blade propellers with opposite rotation.\\n\\nOrdinary piston engines couldn't provide the required speed characteristics for a well-armed, long-range aircraft capable of carrying a significant load, so Westland's designers chose a turbo-prop engine. However, its development and completion dragged on for several years, so the first Westland Wyverns only arrived in Naval Air Force squadrons in 1953.","IDS_PCZC291_BRITISHCVARC_FAIREYBARRACUDA_II":"Fairey Barracuda II","IDS_PCZC291_BRITISHCVARC_FAIREYBARRACUDA_II_DESCRIPTION":"The idea of creating a carrier-based, all-metal monoplane, capable of performing the functions of both torpedo bomber and dive bomber, was first suggested by the Fairey company in the early 1930s. However, the endless stream of discrepant requirements from the Ministry of Aviation to change the design delayed the work for almost a decade. As a result, when the production of the aircraft, named \\\"Barracuda\\\", finally commenced in 1942, its characteristics were far from impressive. The Barracuda II, which began to enter service in the Naval Air Force in early 1943, was slightly better with a more powerful 1,600 hp engine.\\n\\nThe not-too-fast and not-very-maneuverable Barracuda didn't make for a good torpedo bomber. But a number of constructive advantages allowed it to cope well with the role of a dive bomber. The most striking moment of its career was during operation Tungsten, which involved striking battleship Tirpitz, hiding in one of the Norwegian fjords. On April 4, 1944, forty-two Barracudas, coming in two waves, hit the battleship 14 times with their bombs, losing only three planes in the assault. The battleship was put out of action for several months. As the Air Force was obtaining American Grumman Avengers—which surpassed the Barracudas in all respects—as part of a lend-lease, the British aircraft became auxiliary planes, focusing mainly on reconnaissance, the mining of enemy harbors and fairways, anti-submarine patrols, and transporting.","IDS_PCZC292_BRITISHCVARC_HOOK":"Hook Not Down!","IDS_PCZC292_BRITISHCVARC_HOOK_DESCRIPTION":"Landing Signal Officers (LSOs) appeared onboard U.S. Navy and Royal Navy aircraft carriers in the 1920s. Legend has it that the one who started the practice was the Commander of USS Langley, America's first aircraft carrier. When seeing a potentially unsuccessful aircraft landing, Commander Whiting (first executive officer) decided to give the pilot signals indicating the actions that should be performed, waving with a pair of white sailor caps that he had at hand.\\n\\nOne of the first actions the pilot had to perform when starting their approach was to release the landing hook. If the pilot forgot to do this, the signal officer would remind him to do it by waving their paddles up and down.","IDS_PCZC293_BRITISHCVARC_SLANT":"Slant!","IDS_PCZC293_BRITISHCVARC_SLANT_DESCRIPTION":"The main task of the landing signal officers was to ensure the safety of aircraft landing on the deck, and to reduce the intervals between each of their arrivals on the aircraft carrier. The signal systems in the U.S. and U.K. Navies were different, and in case of joint operations, the commanders had to coordinate which of the systems would be used each time.\\n\\nAfter the landing gear and hook were released, the pilot had to level the plane. Stretching his arms to the sides and inclining them, the signal officer showed the direction in which the plane had to level its wings. If necessary, he could supplement the signal by raising his foot and thus \\\"indicating\\\" how to work with a pedal.","IDS_PCZC294_BRITISHCVARC_HIGH_DIP":"Hi Dip!","IDS_PCZC294_BRITISHCVARC_HIGH_DIP_DESCRIPTION":"Until the emergence of radio communication between the pilot and the signal post in the 1950s, deck landing was corrected purely by visual signals. Before World War II, a certain set of signals had already been developed, which, as a rule, were given using special devices that resembled paddles.\\n\\nSimultaneously with the leveling of the aircraft, the landing signal officer informed the pilot what altitude he should take. The \\\"Hi Dip!\\\" signal looked like this: from the normal \\\"Roger\\\" position (arms stretched out to the sides), the LSO simultaneously raised both paddles by about 45 degrees several times until the pilot followed his instructions.","IDS_PCZC295_BRITISHCVARC_CUT_THROTTLE":"Cut!","IDS_PCZC295_BRITISHCVARC_CUT_THROTTLE_DESCRIPTION":"Aircraft arrived on a carrier from the stern of the ship, and the pilots usually approached her from the port side. Hence, the platform specially designated for the signaling officers was situated along the port side at the rear part of the deck.\\n\\nIf the landing was going well, and the pilot followed all of the instructions of the LSO, the latter gave the final signal allowing the landing. In the U.S. Navy, it was called a Cut Throttle signal because it sounded a bit like \\\"cut throat\\\". Thus, the signal resembled the movement of a hand cutting the throat.","IDS_PCZC296_BRITISHCVARC_HMS_HERMES":"HMS Hermes","IDS_PCZC296_BRITISHCVARC_HMS_HERMES_DESCRIPTION":"Laid down in January 1918, HMS Hermes was the world's first ship designed as an aircraft carrier from day one of its inception. On the basis of the results of trials held with her predecessors, ships converted from other types, changes in the new project were made even at the final stages of construction. As a result, the ship that entered service in early 1924 had all of the features of a classic aircraft carrier: a closed hangar, solid flight deck, and an island-type superstructure shifted to the starboard side. The 11,000-ton HMS Hermes could carry two dozen planes onboard and reach a speed of up to 25 knots.\\n\\nHMS Hermes spent most of her peacetime service in the Far East, looking after the interests of the British Crown in the region. One of the tasks that she had to perform—quite unusual for an aircraft carrier—was to fight against pirates. At the beginning of World War II, Hermes, based out of African ports, participated in the search for German raiders and blockade breakers in Atlantic waters. In early 1942, she was assigned to the British Eastern Fleet and arrived in Ceylon. In April of the same year, the Japanese fleet launched a raid in the Indian Ocean. On April 9, HMS Hermes, on her voyage to join with the main forces of the Eastern Fleet, was intercepted and sunk by Japanese dive bombers.","IDS_PCZC297_BRITISHCVARC_HMS_FURIOUS":"HMS Furious","IDS_PCZC297_BRITISHCVARC_HMS_FURIOUS_DESCRIPTION":"The story how one of the first British aircraft carriers, HMS Furious, was created is quite remarkable. It was laid down in 1915 as a ship of a unique type—a light battlecruiser. When, two years later, Furious entered service, she was a strange hybrid: on her bow she had a hangar with a flight deck, while her stern was occupied by a turret with a 457 mm gun, a monstrous weapon for its time. Furious would enter service three more times, following another modernization that changed her appearance. By 1932, she had been turned into an aircraft carrier with an island-type superstructure and flight deck occupying three-quarters of her hull's length. She was capable of accelerating to nearly 30 knots and carrying more than 30 aircraft onboard.\\n\\nAt the beginning of World War II, HMS Furious hunted German raiders in the Atlantic. In the spring of 1940, she took an active part in the Norwegian operation. Later on, her main goal mostly consisted of transferring aircraft to various theaters of war, from the Arctic to Malta. In late 1942, she covered the landing in North Africa and, in 1944, she participated in striking battleship Tirpitz, based in Norway. A few months prior to the end of the war in Europe, the old ship was put into reserve and then removed from the fleet lists.","IDS_PCZC298_BRITISHCVARC_HMS_IMPLACABLE":"HMS Implacable","IDS_PCZC298_BRITISHCVARC_HMS_IMPLACABLE_DESCRIPTION":"One of the best aircraft carriers of the Royal Navy, HMS Implacable entered service in August 1944. Like the Illustrious-class aircraft carriers that had been commissioned before her, she had a very important advantage—an armored flight deck. However, unlike her predecessors, HMS Implacable had a double-deck hangar, which, coupled with the possibility of placing aircraft directly on the deck, significantly increased the size of her air group.\\n\\nAfter entering service and until the end of 1944, Implacable took part in hostilities off the coast of Norway. In the spring of 1945, she headed for the Pacific Ocean, with the largest air group onboard ever deployed on a British aircraft carrier—81 aircraft. Throughout a period of several months until the end of World War II, HMS Implacable took part in strikes against strategic targets on the Japanese islands. After the war, for a long time, the aircraft carrier served as a training ship to test out the latest models of carrier-based aircraft. In 1949, she was the flagship of the Home Fleet. Six years later, HMS Implacable was sold for scrap.","IDS_PCZC299_BRITISHCVARC_800_NAVALAIRSQUADRON":"800 Naval Air Squadron","IDS_PCZC299_BRITISHCVARC_800_NAVALAIRSQUADRON_DESCRIPTION":"The 800 Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm carrier-based squadron was formed in 1933, topping the list of the \\\"numbered\\\" combat units of the Naval Air Force. Five years later, it became the first unit to receive the latest Blackburn Skua strike dive bombers. During World War II, the squadron's aircraft took off from the decks of a variety of aircraft carriers—the honored Furious, the legendary Ark Royal, and the state-of-the-art Indomitable. In April 1940, during the Norwegian campaign, the squadron was reported to have become the first ever aircraft formation to sink a major combat ship. It happened during the raid on Bergen, where Skua dive bombers sent German light cruiser Königsberg to the bottom.\\n\\nThe combat geography of the 800 Naval Air Squadron is extremely extensive, with its aircraft operating in the Arctic and Mediterranean, in the hunt for Bismarck, and in covering the Allied landings in Madagascar and North Africa. In the summer of 1943, the squadron became the first Naval Air Force division to be equipped with American-made Grumman Hellcat fighters. The Hellcats of the 800 Air Squadron covered a strike of British dive bombers on battleship Tirpitz during Operation Tungsten, in April 1944. In the final stage of the war, the squadron took part in the hostilities in the Pacific.","IDS_PCZC300_AZURLANE_HAMMANN":"Hammann","IDS_PCZC300_AZURLANE_HAMMANN_DESCRIPTION":"What are you looking at?

On December 30, 1937, the Navy got out of control of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army and formed a separate military service called the People's Commissariat for the U.S.S.R. Navy. The first professional officer appointed to the position of the service's People's Commissar (\\\"Narodny Kommissar\\\" in Russian) was Nikolay Gerasimovich Kuznetsov, Flagman Flota 2 Ranga (Flag Officer 2nd rank).\\n\\nLike any senior military officer, the People's Commissar for the Navy was supposed to establish the official flag. Such a flag was hoisted atop the mast of a ship or other water craft with the People's Commissar aboard. The flag was a red cloth with the Naval Flag of the U.S.S.R. in its upper corner close to the pole and a red star placed in yellow laurel wreath with a ribbon. This flag was used all the time as long as the position of the People's Commissar remained in use. In February 1946, the People's Commissariat for the Navy was abolished, and Admiral Kuznetsov became the Deputy People's Commissar for the Armed Forces of the U.S.S.R.","IDS_PCZC337_SOVIETBBARC_EPAULETS":"Shoulder Board of Admiral Flota (1944)","IDS_PCZC337_SOVIETBBARC_EPAULETS_DESCRIPTION":"In May 1940, the generalship and admiralty were introduced in the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union. Accordingly, the People's Commissar for the U.S.S.R. Navy Nikolay Gerasimovich Kuznetsov, previously being Flagman Flota 2 Ranga (Flag Officer 2nd rank) was awarded the rank of Admiral. The highest rank in the naval hierarchy was Admiral Flota, but at that time, no one was considered worthy of the title.\\n\\nIt wasn't until May 1944 that the People's Commissar for the Navy, Kuznetsov, and his deputy, Admiral Isakov, were the first to be awarded the rank of the Admiral Flota (Admiral of the Fleet). It was around that time that the corresponding insignias were developed. As the decree of 1940 implied the correspondence of the Admiral Flota rank to the Army General of the Land Forces, four stars were placed on the Admiral Flota shoulder boards of 1944 by analogy with the army ranks. In May 1945, a special decree equated the ranks of the Admiral Flota to the Marshal of the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Marshal-type shoulder boards with the emblem of the U.S.S.R. and one big star were introduced.","IDS_PCZC338_SOVIETBBARC_BALTIETS_PISTOL":"The Baltiets Pistol (1942)","IDS_PCZC338_SOVIETBBARC_BALTIETS_PISTOL_DESCRIPTION":"The harsh winter of 1941–1942 was a severe test not only for the citizens and defenders of the blockaded Leningrad. Weapons and military equipment also was seriously affected. Thus, the TT pistol, being in service with the army and navy, often malfunctioned in freezing temperatures. Kontr-Admiral Rall, Chief of Staff of the Baltic Navy, requested the higher authorities to produce a more reliable pistol at one of the Leningrad plants to arm the naval officers.\\n\\nAfter considering the issue, the Leningrad Regional Committee of the Communist Party appointed Plant No. 181 to design and manufacture the first batch of new pistols as soon as possible. Having received just drawings of the parts in January 1942, the masters at the plant made a prototype by hand. In March 1942, it was successfully tested at the temperature of −30 degrees Celsius. The pistol, named Baltiets in honor of the Baltic Navy, had a 7.62 mm caliber and a magazine for eight cartridges. Under the blockade, a total of 14 Baltiets pistols were made by hand. Admiral Nikolay Gerasimovich Kuznetsov, the People's Commissar for the Navy, was given the pistol with serial number 2 and the dedicatory inscription as a present.","IDS_PCZC339_SOVIETBBARC_GAZ_A":"GAZ-A Car (1935)","IDS_PCZC339_SOVIETBBARC_GAZ_A_DESCRIPTION":"In 1933, Nikolay Gerasimovich Kuznetsov was appointed the Commander of light cruiser Chervona Ukraina. Under his command, the cruiser soon became the best ship of the Black Sea Navy in terms of combat training. The Soviet statesmen visited Chervona Ukraina many times. Among them was Sergo Ordzhonikidze, the People's Commissar of Heavy Industry, who was in charge of shipbuilding and production of Soviet cars. Impressed by the crew's training level and the ship's excellent condition, he presented the cruiser Commander with the GAZ-A.\\n\\nGAZ-A was the first Soviet passenger car of mass production. It was produced between 1932 and 1936 and was a licensed copy of the American Ford Model A, as it was impossible for the Soviet industry of the early 1930s to assimilate the production of an original model. A simple five-passenger phaeton, equipped with a 40 hp engine and bearing similar design to truck GAZ-AA, was supposed to be used not only for civilian needs. The Red Army was massively supplied with GAZ-A to be used mainly as a command vehicle.","IDS_PCZC340_SOVIETBBARC_305MM":"305 mm Gun of 1907","IDS_PCZC340_SOVIETBBARC_305MM_DESCRIPTION":"Having analyzed the experience of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, the Admiralty command came to the conclusion that the main caliber guns of the new battleships should have much better ballistics and range of fire than the 305 mm, 40 caliber guns installed on the majority of the Russian squadron battleships. Initially, the armament of the designed battleship was supposed to be placed in double-gun turrets, but the Naval General Staff insisted on installation in triple turrets.\\n\\nThe new 305 mm, 52 caliber gun was designed at the Obukhov Plant in St. Petersburg. The first copy was made in 1907. The three-gun turret was developed at the Metal Plant in St. Petersburg. The turrets of the Baltic battleships (Sevastopol, Gangut, and others) were protected by 203 mm thick armored plates. The maximum gun elevation angle was 25 degrees, which provided a 24 km range of fire of the 1911 shell. Later, after the modernization of one of the battleships, the gun elevation angle increased to 40 degrees, which extended the range of fire to 30 km.","IDS_PCZC341_SOVIETBBARC_356MM":"356 mm Gun of 1913","IDS_PCZC341_SOVIETBBARC_356MM_DESCRIPTION":"In 1911, when development of the new armored cruisers (future Izmail-class battlecruisers) for the Baltic Sea began, it was already known that ships armed with 343 mm artillery guns were being constructed in England. It was obvious that other countries would soon follow the example of the British and increase the caliber of their new dreadnoughts. In this regard, the Russian Naval Services decided to make 356 mm guns the main weapon of future ships.\\n\\nIt is quite natural that the guns and turrets for the battleships were designed on the basis of the Gangut/Sevastopol-type guns and turrets that had already been put into production. Being very powerful for their time, the 356 mm, 52 caliber guns, developed in 1913 at the Obukhov Plant, were able to fire 748 kg shells at a range of more than 23 km at a maximum turret elevation angle of 25 degrees, according to the project. In 1914, World War I was the reason the Empire's industry diverted to the more pressing issues. As a result, work on neither the battleships nor the turrets was ever completed. The 356 mm gun only was put into operation in test range equipment operated during the Leningrad defense of World War II.","IDS_PCZC342_SOVIETBBARC_406MM":"B-37 406 mm Gun","IDS_PCZC342_SOVIETBBARC_406MM_DESCRIPTION":"The design of 406 mm sea guns began in Russia in 1914. Up until the end of World War I, future battleships were supposed to be armed with such artillery. The design of the Great Navy battleships began in the U.S.S.R. in 1936. They were also supposed to have 406 mm guns, but the best practices from 20 years ago were no longer suitable. Between 1937 and 1940, the 50 caliber B-37 gun was designed and manufactured at the Bolshevik Plant in Leningrad.\\n\\nThe range tests of the B-37 guns were carried out in the second half of 1940. The firing velocity of a 1,108 kg shell was 830 m/s. The firing range at an optimum elevation angle of 45 degrees exceeded 45.5 km. The B-37 guns were the main weapons of the Sovetsky Soyuz-class battleships. Triple turrets were designed at the Leningrad Metal Plant, which once developed turrets for the first Russian dreadnoughts. The total weight of each mount was about 2,400 tons, and the turret was supposed to be operated in combat conditions by 100 people.","IDS_PCZC343_SOVIETBBARC_457MM":"457 mm Naval Gun","IDS_PCZC343_SOVIETBBARC_457MM_DESCRIPTION":"After the end of World War II, when new Soviet battleships (Project 24) were being designed, various armament configurations were envisaged. Having studied the characteristics of possible enemy ships, a special commission assembled by the Navy Chief Command came to the conclusion that Soviet ships must be armed with 457 mm guns in order to fight successfully against the most powerful of them (e.g., American Iowa-class battleships).\\n\\nDespite outstanding combat data (with a range of fire of up to 52 km), calculations for a triple 457 mm turret made in 1949 showed that such mounts would have substantial mass and size drawbacks. Such turrets would be almost twice as heavy as those of Sovetsky Soyuz-class battleships, and the draught and cost of Project 24 ships would be beyond the reach of Soviet industry. For that matter, the project developers abandoned this armament configuration and returned to 406 mm caliber.","IDS_PCZC344_SOVIETBBARC_GANGUT_MEDAL":"Medal for the Victory in the Battle of Gangut","IDS_PCZC344_SOVIETBBARC_GANGUT_MEDAL_DESCRIPTION":"On July 27 (August 9), 1714, during the Great Northern War, the Russian rowing fleet under the command of Admiral Apraksin and Admiral Mikhailov (Peter the Great fought in this battle under the name of the latter) blocked a detachment of Swedish ships near the Gangut peninsula. Peter the Great participated in a boarding battle, as a result of which all ten enemy ships were taken. The Battle of Gangut was the first victory of the Russian regular fleet, and it was greatly celebrated in St. Petersburg.\\n\\nThe following medals were coined in memory of the battle: gold—for officers, silver—for sailors and soldiers. The portrait of Peter the Great wearing a suit of armor and a laurel wreath was on the obverse of the medal. The sea battle, dated July 27, 1714, between the Russian galleys and the Swedish squadron was on the reverse. In 1719, a 90-gun wind-driven battleship named in honor of the battle of Gangut was launched.

Russian troops attempted to take the fortress several times with no success. However, in early December 1790, General Alexander Suvorov joined the command of the besiegers, and the fate of Izmail was decided. \\\"I came here with the troops. Twenty-four hours for reflection, and you will be given freedom. My first shot will mean your captivity. When we assault, only death awaits you\\\". This was Suvorov's ultimatum to the Turks. On December 11, 1790, after a violent assault, Izmail fell. Its first commandant was General Mikhail Kutuzov, who distinguished himself during the capture of the fortress and who would later defeat Napoleon in the war of 1812.\\n\\nInspired by its success, Catherine the Great awarded all the soldiers, cossacks and sailors who participated in the siege, a silver service medal. The medal was oval-shaped and made of silver. The monogram of the Empress was on the obverse of the medal. The inscription \\\"For Outstanding Bravery During the Capture of Izmail on December 11, 1790\\\" was on the reverse. In June 1915, almost 125 years after this glorious victory, battlecruiser Izmail was launched in St. Petersburg. It was the main cruiser in a series of four ships, each with 32,500 tons of displacement.","IDS_PCZC346_SOVIETBBARC_SINOP_MEDAL":"Medal for the Battle of Sinop","IDS_PCZC346_SOVIETBBARC_SINOP_MEDAL_DESCRIPTION":"In the morning of November 18 (30), 1853, six Russian battleships under the command of Vitse-Admiral (Vice Admiral) Nakhimov entered the bay of Sinop on the Black Sea coast of Turkey. The enemy squadron was concentrated under the cover of several coastal batteries in the city harbor. At 12:30 pm, the Russian ships opened fire. The Turkish flotilla was destroyed within a couple of hours, and the shore batteries turned into ruins. The Russian squadron lost 37 people. The Battle of Sinop remained in history as the last major battle of the wind-driven fleet era.\\n\\nShortly after the end of the Eastern (Crimean) War of 1853–1856, a special medal was established to reward its participants. On its obverse, there were the monograms of Nicholas I and Alexander II, who reigned during the war, and the years: \\\"1853–1854–1855–1856\\\". A quote from the Old Testament was on its reverse side. The medal for the participants of the Battle of Sinop was made of light bronze and it was to be worn on the St. George's ribbon. A 130-gun wind-driven steam battleship named after the victory at Sinop was launched two years after the end of the war. A few decades later, in 1889, squadron battleship Sinop joined the Black Sea Fleet.","IDS_PCZC347_SOVIETBBARC_SUVOROV_MEDAL":"Generalissimo Suvorov Commemorative Badge","IDS_PCZC347_SOVIETBBARC_SUVOROV_MEDAL_DESCRIPTION":"In 1900, Russia celebrated the 100th anniversary of the death of the great Russian commander Generalissimo Alexander Vasilyevich Suvorov (1730–1800).

The laying of squadron battleship Knyaz Suvorov, taking place in September 1901 in St. Petersburg, was also closely connected with these events.\\n\\nIn 1904, Knyaz Suvorov entered service and became the flagship of the Second Pacific Squadron. In May 1905, the battleship was sunk off Tsushima Island in a battle with the Japanese Navy.

In his memoirs, he jokes bitterly about the unique character of his service in the Navy: he was twice a Kontr-Admiral (Rear-Admiral), three times Vitse-Admiral (Vice Admiral), and twice Admiral Flota (Fleet Admiral).\\n\\nIn May 1955, the Fleet Admiral rank was renamed Admiral Flota Sovietskogo Soyuza (Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union). Those who were promoted to Admiral Flota Sovietskogo Soyuza were given Marshal's star. The star was worn on the neck with the parade uniform. Starting from 1952, admirals were supposed to wear parade uniform that included a black coat with golden shoulder marks and a turn-down collar with golden sewing work.

The shells were of approximately 2.6 calibers, which limited the amount of explosive agent they could carry to a tiny 5 to 12 kg. The experience from the Russo-Japanese war was taken into account and, in 1907, new elongated shells with a large amount of explosive agent were put into service. However, the design and construction of dreadnought battleships, which began in 1906, required fundamentally more powerful ammunition.\\n\\nIn 1911, a project was approved for a new shell, designed for a 305 mm/52 caliber gun. Ammunition of all three types—armor-piercing, semi-armor-piercing and high explosive—had the same weight of 471 kg. At the same time, AP shells were filled with 13 kg of explosives, which is more than the amount that HE shells of the Russo-Japanese war period contained. The 5 caliber (152 cm) Model 1911 HE shell that contained 61.5 kg of explosive agent was immensely destructive. The magazines Gangut/Sevastopol-class battleships were designed to hold 1,200 305 mm shells, 100 shells per gun.","IDS_PCZC357_SOVIETBBARC_356MM_SHELL":"Model 1913 356 mm Shell","IDS_PCZC357_SOVIETBBARC_356MM_SHELL_DESCRIPTION":"The \\\"Armored Cruisers for the Baltic Sea\\\", which at the design and construction stage turned into Izmail-class battlecruisers, were to carry 356 mm guns as main artillery guns. The increase of the caliber by \\\"only\\\" 51 mm, in turn increased the weight of the the corresponding shell by more than one half. The ammunition of the 356 mm guns had a mass of about 748 kg versus 471 kg for 305 mm cannons.\\n\\nTwo main types of 356 mm shells entered service—the armor-piercing Model 1911 shell and the high-explosive Model 1913 shell. Both had the same weight, differing in the amount of explosive agent and length. The Model 1913 shell was about 170 cm long and was filled with 82 kg of explosives. In accordance with the project, the volume of the magazines of the Izmail-class battlecruisers provided storage of 80 shots per gun, a total of 960 shells.","IDS_PCZC358_SOVIETBBARC_406MM_SHELL":"406 mm Shell for the B-37 Gun","IDS_PCZC358_SOVIETBBARC_406MM_SHELL_DESCRIPTION":"406 mm 50-caliber guns for Sovetsky Soyuz-class battleships (name-code B-37) were among the most powerful naval artillery systems in the world. Their shells were produced by the Bolshevik plant in Leningrad, the design office of which played a major role in the design of the guns themselves.\\n\\nThe main types of ammunition for the B-37 systems were armor-piercing and semi-armor-piercing shells. The weight of each was 1,108 kg. The armor-piercing shell was slightly smaller, but still having a 1.9-meter length it was of rather considerable dimensions. With an initial speed of 830 m/s, such a shell penetrated a 406 mm armor plate from a distance of 13.6 km at a 25 degree angle of incidence. The magazine design capacity of Sovetsky Soyuz-class battleships was 900 shells for main-caliber guns. World War II prevented these mighty ships from being built, but an experimental B-37 cannon was actually used in combat: 81 projectiles were fired at enemy positions from a test site near Leningrad.","IDS_PCZC359_SOVIETBBARC_457MM_SHELL":"457 mm Shell for Project 24 Battleships","IDS_PCZC359_SOVIETBBARC_457MM_SHELL_DESCRIPTION":"Design calculations for a 457 mm gun, one of the main armament variants for post-war battleships (Project 24), were made in 1949 and provided for a 50-caliber gun barrel. The initial velocity of the 1580 kg shell was 850 m/s, the shell of 1,720 kg had an initial velocity of 820 m/s. The weight and size of the turret with three guns made the displacement of the Project 24 battleships unbearable for the Soviet industry. At the same time, the power of the 50-caliber gun was excessive, based on the characteristics of battleships that were part of foreign fleets at that time.\\n\\nReducing the length of the 457 mm gun barrel to 48 calibers would provide a 1,580 kg shell with an initial speed of about 800 m/s, which guaranteed penetration of the armor of Iowa-class American battleships, the main suspected opponent of the project 24 ships, at all reasonable angles and flight paths. Based on the similar characteristics of the 406 mm shells for B-37 guns, the ammunition for the 457 mm gun would have been over 2.1 m long, with an explosive weight ranging from 36 to 128 kg, depending on the shell type: armor-piercing or explosive.","IDS_PCZC360_SOVIETBBARC_USHAKOV_ORDER":"The Order of Ushakov","IDS_PCZC360_SOVIETBBARC_USHAKOV_ORDER_DESCRIPTION":"In March 1944, in the midst of the War, the Order of Ushakov was established in the U.S.S.R., becoming the highest award specially designed for Navy officers.

Born into a poor family, he entered a higher educational establishment shortly before the beginning of World War I, so he had to juggle his studies and work at a port. A number of times he had to abandon his studies and work at dockyards to feed himself. After receiving the specialty of a ship constructor in 1930, Bespolov was involved in the design and construction of the Leningrad-class destroyer flotilla leaders.\\n\\nFrom the mid-1930s, Fedot Bespolov worked at the Central Design Bureau of Special Shipbuilding No. 1, later known as Central Design Bureau No. 17, taking part in designing Gnevny-class destroyers. In 1939, a talented engineer was appointed to the post of chief designer of the Project 69, Kronshtadt-class super heavy cruisers armed with 305 mm artillery. In the midst of the Great Patriotic War, Bespolov led the development of Project 24, a further development of Sovetsky Soyuz-class battleships. The design of these ships was to take into account the experience of World War II and embody the most advanced achievements of Soviet shipbuilding. Both 406 mm and 457 mm guns were considered as options for battleships armament. Besides, in accordance with the project designed at 1950, they had to be equipped with the most advanced universal artillery and the latest radar equipment.","IDS_PCZC368_FRENCHDDARC_ENSEIGNE_GABOLDE":"Enseigne Gabolde","IDS_PCZC368_FRENCHDDARC_ENSEIGNE_GABOLDE_DESCRIPTION":"At the beginning of the 20th century, the entire French naval shipbuilding industry went all out to commission as many battleships and armored cruisers into the Navy as it could. As a result, the Republic's Navy entered World War I with practically no light forces in their service. The only destroyers it had were too weak and scarce in number. \\n\\nAmong the largest French destroyers that entered service after the war had already broken out were Enseigne Roux-class ships. The only armament they carried were several 100 and 65 mm guns coupled with two single-tube torpedo launchers. The third ship in the series was Enseigne Gabolde, which was completed only in 1923 under a design altered to draw on the experience gained during the war. The destroyer turned out to significantly outgun her former sister ships. Enseigne Gabolde's main battery guns were turned into dual-purpose ones, comprising three 100 mm guns. Another alteration was to equip this destroyer with twin-tube torpedo launchers. The ship was named after ship-of-the-line ensign Jean Gabolde, who died in 1911 in an explosion that destroyed battleship Liberté.","IDS_PCZC369_FRENCHDDARC_BOURRASQUE":"Bourrasque","IDS_PCZC369_FRENCHDDARC_BOURRASQUE_DESCRIPTION":"Laid down between 1922–1923, six Jaguar-class large destroyers and 12 Bourrasque-class destroyers represented a giant leap forward for the development of the torpedo boat-type ships in the French Navy. Even relatively small \\\"Bourrasques\\\" were almost double the size of their prewar predecessors. The use of 130 mm guns on series-produced destroyers in the 1920's was an extraordinary solution, too. The 12 ships were named after various winds and other weather activities—Cyclone (\\\"Cyclone\\\"), Ouragan (\\\"Hurricane\\\"), and Tornade (\\\"Tornado\\\") to name a few. In French and a number of other languages, the word \\\"bourrasque\\\" is used to mean a sharp gust of cold wind that is often aggravated by rain, hail, or snow. \\n\\nBy the time that World War II broke out, Bourrasque-class destroyers were already relatively outdated, yet they were still used extensively. Four destroyers were sunk during the defense of the northern coast of France between May–June 1940, including Siroco, and the lead ship Bourrasque which was lost off the coast of Dunkirk. Three more ships of the series perished during the Allied landings in North Africa in November 1942. After a brief period of service in the Italian Navy, destroyer Trombe, which had earlier survived a flooding in Toulon, saw action in battles with German ships in the Mediterranean in 1945.","IDS_PCZC370_FRENCHDDARC_GUEPARD":"Guépard","IDS_PCZC370_FRENCHDDARC_GUEPARD_DESCRIPTION":"A further development of the post-war Jaguar-class large destroyers, six Guépard-class ships entered service between 1929–1931.

It must be said, though, that an encounter with any \\\"Guépards\\\" could turn into a dangerous adventure, even for the Italian light cruisers with thin armor that were built during the late 1920s and early 1930s. \\n\\nGuépard-class large destroyers were followed by two more series of ships with similar characteristics. These were the Aigle-and Vauquelin-class ships, which retained the sleek four-smock-stack design of their prototype. All the \\\"Guépards\\\" saw service in various theaters of World War II: in the North Sea, the Mediterranean, and off the Atlantic coast of Africa.

However, Le Terrible emerged victorious in this race, having sustained a speed of 45 knots, an unsurpassed speed record for a large surface ship. According to a tradition adopted in the French armed forces, everyone who served on a ship after her commissioning ordered badges with her emblem. Le Terrible's emblem depicted a black cobra encircling a red letter \\\"T\\\".\\n\\nDuring World War II, Le Terrible had a rich operational record. In the autumn of 1939, she participated in the hunt for German commerce raiders in the Atlantic as she intercepted and sank the blockade runner Santa Fe. After an upgrade in the United States in 1943, Le Terrible saw action off the coast of Italy, took part in the liberation of Corsica, supported the landings in the south of France, and countered hostile shipping in the Adriatic.","IDS_PCZC381_FRENCHDDARC_MOGADOR":"Mogador","IDS_PCZC381_FRENCHDDARC_MOGADOR_DESCRIPTION":"The finest of the French large destroyers. The most powerful representatives of this type of ship were Mogador and Volta. By their dimensions (a length exceeding 137 meters) and fire power (eight 139 mm guns), ships of this type were almost closer to light cruisers, yet far outmatching them in terms of speed. The lead ship, Mogador, named after the French-African Morocco port city, entered service in June 1938. Military defense constructions built in Mogador in the 18th century served as the basis for the ship's badge.\\n\\nCreated for actions alongside high-speed battleships of the Dunkerque class, at the beginning of World War II Mogador and Volta joined them as part of the Raiding Force (French: \\\"Force de raid\\\"). Right up until the fall of France, both ships had seen active service in the Atlantic, in the Northern Sea and in the Mediterranean. In July 1940, after the Vichy regime was established in France, the British fleet attacked French ships at the base at Mers-el-Kébir. During the attack, Mogador was hit by a 381 mm British shell and sustained severe damage, putting her out of action for quite a time. In November 1942, Mogador was scuttled in Toulon Harbor to keep her from falling into German hands.","IDS_PCZC382_FRENCHDDARC_VAUQUELIN":"Vauquelin","IDS_PCZC382_FRENCHDDARC_VAUQUELIN_DESCRIPTION":"French naval officer Jean Vauquelin made a name for himself during battles against the English off the coast of Canada during the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). In June 1758 he successfully evaded the Royal Navy's blockade of Louisbourg twice. Those exploits of his were subsequently congratulated by the French and British alike. In May 1760, while escorting a fleet of transport ships, Vauquelin, who commanded a small frigate, was pursued by a British squadron led by the 74-gun ship-of-the-line, Vanguard. Within the two-hour gallant fight that followed, the frigate fired all of her ammunition. The ship was almost burnt to ashes, and her defiant commander taken prisoner. However, in a tribute to Vauquelin's valor and dedication, the British soon released him to become a national hero of France, and subsequently of French-speaking Canada. \\n\\nIn September 1932, a large destroyer designated \\\"Vauquelin\\\" was launched in the city of Dunkirk in northern France. The ship's badge is based on the coat-of-arms of the Canadian province of Quebec, in the defense of which Jean Vauquelin left his mark in history.","IDS_PCZC383_FRENCHDDARC_KLEBER":"Kléber","IDS_PCZC383_FRENCHDDARC_KLEBER_DESCRIPTION":"In 1939, France commenced work on the design of \\\"3,000-ton scout ships,\\\" intending to further build upon the concept of the Mogador-class large destroyers. The plan provided for as many as four of such ships to be constructed. The new warships were supposed to join Mogador and Volta to make up a full squadron of six ships. At the beginning of the war with Germany, the new large destroyers were named after the generals of the Great French Revolution who rose to fame in battles against the Germans and Austrians: Kléber, Marceau, Hoche, and Desaix. \\n\\nAll four—Jean-Baptiste Kléber, François Séverin Marceau, Lazare Hoche, and Louis Charles Antoine Desaix—knew each other well enough, as at various times they had fought side by side. Marceau received a fatal wound in 1796 in a battle against the Austrians. Hoche, a good friend of his, died one year later. On June 14, 1800, on the same day that an Austrian bullet struck General Desaix during the battle of Marengo in Italy, Kléber, who was in command of the Egyptian army, was assassinated in Cairo. After nearly 140 years, in April 1940, the shipyards at Dunkirk, Nantes, and Lorient received an order for the construction of four ships with their sides adorned with the names of these glorious commanders.","IDS_PCZC384_ITCA_ERITREA_1937":"Eritrea, 1937","IDS_PCZC384_ITCA_ERITREA_1937_DESCRIPTION":"For most of its history, the Kingdom of Italy was a colonial power. By the mid-1930s, it possessed a vast swathe of the African continent, and one of the prerequisites of retaining its position was the kingdom's own naval forces. One of the ships specifically designed for service in tropical waters away from the homeland was Eritrea, named after the oldest Italian colony in Eastern Africa.\\n\\nEritrea was outfitted with unconventional diesel and diesel-electric power plants, providing the 2,200-ton sloop with quite a solid operational range for her size. Her four 120 mm quick-firing guns enabled her to provide gunfire support while operating in coastal areas. Her good anti-aircraft complement for the mid-1930s theoretically made it possible to also repel any threats from the air. Owing to her well-fitted workshops and extensive living spaces on board, Eritrea could serve as a floating base for submarines. The original design of the ship allowed her to be used as a mine layer and carry a multi-purpose reconnaissance aircraft on board.","IDS_PCZC385_ITCA_NINOBIXIO_1914":"Nino Bixio, 1914","IDS_PCZC385_ITCA_NINOBIXIO_1914_DESCRIPTION":"At the beginning of 1911, Italy had four dreadnought battleships at various stages of construction, with preparations being made for two more to be laid down. However, at that time, the Italian Navy did not have a single cruiser with a sufficiently high speed to serve as a reconnaissance ship for the new capital ships, except for Quarto, which was still on the stocks. In February 1911, two more cruisers were laid down, officially classified as \\\"scouts\\\" (Italian, \\\"Esploratori\\\")—Nino Bixio and Marsala.\\n\\nThe lead ship was named Nino Gerolamo Bixio, after the recipient of the gold medal \\\"For Military Valor\\\" (1821–1873)—the glorious hero of Italian unification and a companion-in-arms of Giuseppe Garibaldi. Another important reason for the cruiser to be named as such was that Bixio, who eventually became a general and senator towards the end of his life, began his career by joining the Kingdom of Sardinia's Navy.","IDS_PCZC386_ITCA_TARANTO_1915":"Taranto, 1920","IDS_PCZC386_ITCA_TARANTO_1915_DESCRIPTION":"After summing up the results of World War I, most of the surviving ships of the German and former Austro-Hungarian Navies were divided between the victorious powers. From these, Italy received five relatively modern light cruisers. The \\\"oldest\\\" of them, Strassburg, had been in service for less than eight years at the time of her transfer in July 1920.\\n\\nThe cruiser, which was commissioned into the Royal Italian Navy, was renamed \\\"Taranto\\\" in honor of the port city—a naval base in the south of the Apennine Peninsula. The \\\"trophy\\\" ship impressed her new owners. She had more powerful weapons and better armor protection than Italian reconnaissance cruisers, while not being in any way inferior to them in speed. Having outlasted many of her contemporaries, Taranto was decommissioned only at the end of 1942, at the height of World War II.","IDS_PCZC387_ITCA_ABRUZZI_1938":"Duca degli Abruzzi, 1938","IDS_PCZC387_ITCA_ABRUZZI_1938_DESCRIPTION":"The cruiser which was destined to bear the name of Luigi Amedeo, Duke of Abruzzi, was still on the stocks at the time when a ship named after his elder brother (Emanuele Filiberto Duca d’Aosta) entered service in July 1935. The \\\"brother\\\" cruisers—both the younger and the older ones—belonged to the so-called Condottieri class, each being the lead ships in their fifth and fourth series, respectively.\\n\\nDuca degli Abruzzi, which joined the Royal Italian Navy at the end of 1937, ranks among the best light cruisers of the pre-war period. Equipped with ten 152 mm guns that were able to fire a shell with an initial velocity of 910 m/s, side armor of 130 mm in total thickness, and a speed of 34 knots, she was, along with her sistership Giuseppe Garibaldi, the most powerful cruiser among Condottieri-class warships. Having sailed through the entirety of World War II and taken part in military operations both for and against the Axis powers, Duca degli Abruzzi continued to serve in the Italian Navy right up until the 1960s.","IDS_PCZC388_ITCA_LIVIA_SUMMER1940":"On the Way to Libya, Summer of 1940","IDS_PCZC388_ITCA_LIVIA_SUMMER1940_DESCRIPTION":"Northern Africa was the main theater of operations for the Italian army during the initial period of World War II. The task to supply the masses of troops with everything they needed fell on the shoulders of the Navy. Between the ports of the Apennine Peninsula and Libya, convoys of transport ships went one by one, carrying troops, supplies, equipment, and fuel. Protecting that flow of people and resources was one of the main tasks of the ships of the Regia Marina. \\n\\nThe cruisers of the first two series of Condottieri-class ships were hardly suitable for operating within a squadron due to their poor armor protection. But their speed and weaponry made them irreplaceable when it came to providing cover for military convoys, which often consisted of high-speed liners mobilized for the needs of the war. If troops in Africa urgently needed some sort of cargo, cruisers of the di Giussano and Cadorna classes were there to assist in this being relayed. Such intensive use in the most dangerous of areas entailed a logical outcome: five of the six ships of these two series perished during the first two years of the war.","IDS_PCZC389_ITCA_KALABRIA_JULE1940":"1st Cruiser Division at the Battle of Calabria, July 1940","IDS_PCZC389_ITCA_KALABRIA_JULE1940_DESCRIPTION":"Convoys of exceptional importance carrying troops and cargo for the Italian army in Northern Africa were covered by the main forces of the Regia Marina. In some cases, this led to clashes with the British Mediterranean Fleet, which, in turn, were escorting convoys bound for Malta.\\n\\nOn July 9, 1940, a battle took place off the coast of Calabria. It was the first major encounter between British and Italian ships at sea. Ultimately, the opposing fleets parted in a \\\"draw\\\", each having completed their main objective: both the convoys, Maltese and Libyan, arrived safely at their destinations. However, the command of the Italian Navy had every reason to draw disappointing conclusions from the clash. Unlike the British, the Italian Navy did not have its own aircraft, and had to request support from the Army Air Force, which was not under their control. It was with great reluctance and belatedly that the Air Force responded to any requests coming from the Navy. As a result, when a wave of British deck torpedo bombers hit the 1st Cruiser Division (comprising Zara and her two sister ships) during the battle, the Regia Marina sailors were forced to rely on the maneuverability of their ships and the strength of their AA defenses.","IDS_PCZC390_ITCA_GAUDOS_1941":"Battle of the Island of Gavdos, March 1941","IDS_PCZC390_ITCA_GAUDOS_1941_DESCRIPTION":"During the Battle of Greece, at the end of March 1941, another naval engagement between the Italian and British forces took place, this time in the Eastern Mediterranean, south of Cape Matapan. The battle was preceded by an encounter off the island of Gavdos, between the 3rd Cruiser Squadron commanded by Admiral Sansonetti (Trento, Trieste, and Bolzano) and a squadron of British light cruisers (HMS Gloucester, HMAS Perth, and two ships of the Leander class).\\n\\nItalian cruisers outmatched their opponents both by the firing range of their main batteries and their speed. Not tempting fate, the British squadron immediately fell back and retreated, in the hope of entrapping Sansonetti's division with the assistance of their main forces. However, adroit maneuvering allowed the Italian ships to lure the British squadron into the range of the guns of battleship Vittorio Veneto, which had just arrived at the battle area. It was only a timely attack from British aircraft carrier Formidable that helped the Brits to seize the initiative from the Italian forces in the battle.","IDS_PCZC391_ITCA_PANTELLERIA_1942":"Battle of Pantelleria, June 1942","IDS_PCZC391_ITCA_PANTELLERIA_1942_DESCRIPTION":"Supplying equipment and provisions to Malta was of paramount importance to Great Britain. By the summer of 1942, the struggle on the approaches to the island had been ongoing for two years. On June 12, Italian aerial reconnaissance discovered another allied convoy. After waiting for it to approach the coast of Sicily, the 7th Cruiser Division, consisting of Raimondo Montecuccoli and Eugenio di Savoia, set out from Palermo on a mission to intercept it.\\n\\nThe appearance on the horizon of the Italian cruisers approaching at full steam early in the morning of June 15, 1942, came as a complete surprise to the British ships. The escort ships frantically planted smoke screens and maneuvered, yet they were soon forced into battle. German aircraft struck the remaining transport ships that had been left without cover. Towards evening that day, the remains of the convoy ran into a minefield... As a result, only two of the six transport ships carrying cargo that was invaluable to the island's defenders reached Malta. Raimondo Montecuccoli and Eugenio di Savoia returned to base adorned with the laurels of victory.","IDS_PCZC392_ITCA_ALBERTO_DI_GIUSSANO":"Alberto di Giussano","IDS_PCZC392_ITCA_ALBERTO_DI_GIUSSANO_DESCRIPTION":"In the 1930s, the Royal Italian Navy was strengthened with several series of light cruisers, each being a further development of the preceding one. The first four ships, laid down in 1928, received names in honor of condottieri—military leaders of mercenary formations that had participated in the countless wars that plagued Italy in the Middle Ages. The name \\\"Condottieri-class cruisers\\\" was adopted both for this series of ships and for the four series that followed.\\n\\nThe first in this series of ships was Alberto di Giussano, which was commissioned in February 1931. The cruiser was named in honor of Alberto from Giussano—the legendary participant in the struggle of Italian cities against the authority of the German emperor, and a hero of the Battle of Legnano (1176). The commemorative medal worn by the servicemen of this ship depicted the figure of the \\\"Legnano warrior\\\" from a monument erected in the city of the same name. It also bore a quote from the Song of Legnano, composed by the famous Italian poet, Giosuè Carducci, in 1879.","IDS_PCZC393_ITCA_BARTOLOMEO_COLLEONI":"Bartolomeo Colleoni","IDS_PCZC393_ITCA_BARTOLOMEO_COLLEONI_DESCRIPTION":"One of the Alberto di Giussano-class cruisers was named in honor of Bartolomeo Colleoni, a famous Italian commander of the 15th century. Keeping with the trend of his time and serving as a mercenary, Colleoni and his detachment first served the Queen of Naples, and then alternately in the armies of Milan and Venice during the time when they were at war. In 1467, once again at the command of the armed forces of the Republic of San Marco, Colleoni defeated his former employers from Milan at the Battle of Molinella by using—for the first time in history—light field artillery.\\n\\nDeclaring the victor as the \\\"Savior of the Republic,\\\" the Venetians erected a monument in Colleoni's honor. The silhouette of the monument dedicated to the famous condottiero which still decorates the Santi Giovanni e Paolo square in Venice, was depicted on a commemorative medal worn by those who served on the cruiser that bore his name.

The main thing was that they themselves had to be born Italian. For example, Count Raimondo Montecuccoli (1609–1680) fought for most of his life in the forces of the Holy Roman Empire (future Austria-Hungary), which included his native Duchy of Modena.\\n\\nThroughout his entire military career, Count Montecuccoli has risen from the rank of being an ordinary soldier to being generalissimo of all Imperial armies. Among his rivals were the French Marshal, Henri de Turenne, the Swedish, Saxon and Turkish armies, the papal forces of the Pope, and the Prince of Transylvania. Montecuccoli's \\\"Memoires\\\" emerged as sort of a teaching guide for many commanders of the epochs that followed his own. In choosing the name for the next light cruiser, laid down in 1931, the command of the Royal Italian Navy could not ignore such an outstanding personality. The commemorative badge minted for the ship's servicemen depicts an image of the glorious commander's coat of arms with two-headed imperial eagles, and an anagram of his family name: \\\"A hundred eyes\\\" (Latin: \\\"Centum oculi\\\"), which became the unofficial motto of the cruiser.","IDS_PCZC395_ITCA_MUZIO_ATTENDOLO":"Muzio Attendolo","IDS_PCZC395_ITCA_MUZIO_ATTENDOLO_DESCRIPTION":"The second cruiser belonging to the Raimondo Montecuccoli class was Muzio Attendolo, laid down in 1931 and launched in 1934 from the city of Trieste. The ship was named after a mercenary condottiero who lived at the turn of the 15th century, serving with his squad for the rulers of Milan, Florence, Ferrara, and Naples. Renowned for his enormous physical strength, at the dawn of his career, Muzio Attendolo received the nickname \\\"Strong\\\" (Italian: \\\"Sforza\\\"). It was this nickname that gave its name to the famous dynasty he founded, which ruled in Milan during the times of the High Renaissance.\\n\\nThe commemorative badge issued to those who served on the cruiser depicts the ship’s silhouette and motto: \\\"Persistent and invincible\\\" (Latin: \\\"Constans [et] indomitus\\\").

Among them was the city of Trento, one of the centers of the movement for unification with Italy, which only occurred in 1919 following the results of World War I.\\n\\nSuch a significant event had to be reflected in the naming of the Italian Royal Navy ships: the first in a series of cruisers to be laid down after the war ended was named Trento. The ship entered service in 1929 as a conventional \\\"Washington Treaty\\\" cruiser—a fast warship with powerful artillery but poor armor protection. Trento saw extensive action in the Mediterranean Sea during many World War II encounters. In June 1942, she perished during one of the operations against the British who were steaming to Malta.","IDS_PCZC398_ITCA_TRIESTE":"Trieste","IDS_PCZC398_ITCA_TRIESTE_DESCRIPTION":"The accession of Trieste, one of the largest ports and shipbuilding centers in the Mediterranean, was a precondition for Italy to enter World War I on the side of the Entente. The transition of the city in 1918, under the rule of the Italian Crown, was of great importance for the development of the Regia Marina. The very first warship laid down after the war at the shipyard in Trieste—a 10,000-ton cruiser with 203 mm main battery guns—was named Trieste.\\n\\nThe commemorative medal minted for those who served on this ship depicts a symbolic image of the city of Tergestum, the earliest recorded mention of which was attributed to Julius Caesar, as well as the cruiser's motto: \\\"Brought back liberated\\\" (Latin: \\\"Redente redimo\\\"). Following Trieste, a number of other ships were built at the shipyards of the city, including cruisers Muzio Attendolo and Giuseppe Garibaldi, as well as battleships Vittorio Veneto and Roma.","IDS_PCZC399_ITCA_ZARA":"Zara","IDS_PCZC399_ITCA_ZARA_DESCRIPTION":"For centuries, the city of Zara on the Dalmatian coast had been the subject of claims from the Republic of Venice. After the unification of Italy in 1861, the desire to claim this significant port passed \\\"by inheritance\\\" to the Kingdom of Italy. That desire was brought to life only following the results of World War I. By designating the newest heavy cruiser launched in 1930, the lead ship in a series of four, as Zara, the Kingdom of Italy made it clear to the whole world who the city belonged to. The symbol of Venice—the Lion of Saint Mark—depicted on a commemorative medal granted to the ship's servicemen, was reminiscent of the times when the city was under Venetian rule. On the same side of the coin the cruiser's motto: \\\"Persistent\\\" (Italian: \\\"Tenacemente\\\") could be found. \\n\\nAfter Italy entered World War II in June 1940, cruiser Zara did not even last a year. In March 1941, she was sunk by a British squadron in the Battle of Cape Matapan. In 1947, the city of Zara was handed over to Yugoslavia to be re-named the Croatian way—Zadar—which is when the \\\"Italian\\\" page in the city's history came to an end.","IDS_PCZC400_NY2020_PLANNING":"Design","IDS_PCZC400_NY2020_PLANNING_DESCRIPTION":"The first stage in the life of any warship is her design. If the project isn't initiated by the design bureau itself, the whole process starts with an issuance of the Terms of Reference describing the basic performance specifications of the ship. It sometimes has several versions and is issued by the Naval Authorities. With the most suitable sketches of the new ship's appearance and layout selected, detailed development of the project begins. Depending on any changes to the requirements of the future warship and the feasibility of her construction in the context of the country's available resources, the design stage can last anywhere from a few months to several years. For example, the keel of the U.S. Navy's first \\\"large cruiser\\\" was laid down in November 1941, whereas the project's first sketches had appeared back in January 1940.

At the ceremony, these guests usually participate in the first rivet-installing ritual, i.e. placing the ship’s fitting board in the keel structure. However, the occasion of the official keel-laying ceremony doesn't always represent the actual start of the ship's construction.

As a rule, a ship officially receives her name during her ceremonial launching. Attendees of these ceremonies are often quite noble, sometimes even monarchs or heads of state are present for a ship's launch. If a ship inherits the name of one of her predecessors, tradition dictates that one of the namesake's former crew members should be invited to the celebration.

When a rather high-ranking warship is being commissioned, the positive decision of the special Selection Board is followed by a solemn ceremony. Even though this represents the moment when the ship is technically considered to be \\\"in service\\\", she still has a long way to go before she is ready for battle. It will take several months of all kinds of exercises and crew drills to fully master the workings of all her systems and mechanisms, to understand the ship's behavior out in the open sea, and to learn her shooting and maneuverability peculiarities.","IDS_PCZC404_NY2020_RIVETER":"Riveter","IDS_PCZC404_NY2020_RIVETER_DESCRIPTION":"For many decades, from the point that steel became the primary material for hull construction, riveting was an absolutely fundamental part of shipbuilding. It was the most reliable method of securing and fastening the structures of a ship’s hull. Riveting remained immensely hard work, even when pneumatic riveting hammers came into use. The thoroughly coordinated work of two people was required for the installation of each rivet, which would be heated up to 1,000 degrees Celsius, and the number of such rivets on a large ship could amount to hundreds of thousands.","IDS_PCZC405_NY2020_CRANEOPERATOR":"Crane Operator","IDS_PCZC405_NY2020_CRANEOPERATOR_DESCRIPTION":"Nowadays, the image of a woman driving a heavy vehicle or any industrial machine isn't quite out of the ordinary. However, during World War II, such an image was still considered to be rather odd. Nevertheless, men who had left their jobs at industrial enterprises to join the army were replaced by women in nearly all professions, including, for example, that of a crane operator. U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt said that citizens' sacrifices on the home front were no less important for securing victory than the efforts of soldiers serving overseas. The outcome of the war had its roots in the millions of women who picked up heavy equipment or took their places at machine tools when the industry needed them the most.","IDS_PCZC406_NY2020_SHIPFITTER":"Shipfitter","IDS_PCZC406_NY2020_SHIPFITTER_DESCRIPTION":"Assembling a ship's hull includes many different processes, such as riveting, welding, equipment mounting, and painting. For shipbuilding in particular, all the workers involved in these processes are called shipfitters. In the United States during World War II, the majority of shipfitters were women—they accounted for almost 30 percent of all workers in the manufacturing sectors of the U.S. economy. Around this time, images such as \\\"Wendy the Welder\\\" made an appearance, with \\\"Rosie the Riveter\\\" being especially popular.","IDS_PCZC407_NY2020_WELDER":"Welder","IDS_PCZC407_NY2020_WELDER_DESCRIPTION":"During World War I, the process of welding joined the permanent struggle to reduce ships' displacements, and hence the cost of their construction. At first, welding was used in the assembly of relatively \\\"light\\\" frames of superstructures. Over time, with the development of the technology, welding became more widespread, until ships with fully welded hulls finally appeared. As a result, their weight was decreased by 15–20%, and in some cases, even up to 30%. At the same time, the construction time was also reduced.","IDS_PCZC408_NY2020_CRANE":"Harbor Crane","IDS_PCZC408_NY2020_CRANE_DESCRIPTION":"In December 1941, the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, was the only shipyard on the U.S. West Coast capable of accepting and recovering the heavily damaged American battleships that had suffered in the attack on Pearl Harbor. Crane No. 42, which had been in service at the shipyard since 1925, made its contribution to the revival of the battleships and maintenance of the combat effectiveness of other ships participating in the war in the Pacific Ocean. The crane's design enabled it to travel along rails, and the high mobility of cranes of this type meant that they were in demand at all stages of ship construction, repairs, and overhauls.","IDS_PCZC409_NY2020_HAMMERHEAD":"Hammerhead Crane","IDS_PCZC409_NY2020_HAMMERHEAD_DESCRIPTION":"An extremely large crane is required to mount a main caliber turret, the weight of the individual components of which exceeds tens or hundreds of tons, on the hull of a warship. In the era of battleships, the huge cantilever tower cranes (\\\"Hammerheads\\\") handled this task best of all. The crane of this design was invented in Germany at the turn of the 20th century. A total of around 60 Hammerhead cranes were built in the world, mostly in the British Empire and the U.S.A. At the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, the Hammerhead was erected between 1932 and 1933—a huge, 25-storey-tall, 2,400-ton crane, which was taken out of regular use only in the 1990s. To this day, it remains the city's most outstanding and recognizable structure.","IDS_PCZC410_NY2020_LOCO":"Harbor Shunter","IDS_PCZC410_NY2020_LOCO_DESCRIPTION":"Any shipyard where warships are built or repaired needs a constant influx of cargo, whether it's metal, armor, weapons, or propulsion parts. Perhaps the only way to ensure an uninterrupted supply of such items directly to the ship's hull is by rail. Main-line locomotives aren't quite suitable for short-distance transportation along complex, branched networks of the tracks that are typical of any port; small locomotives, the so-called \\\"shunters\\\", are the best fit. In the first half of the 20th century, most of them belonged to the type of tank locomotives—steam locomotives not requiring an additional carriage with fuel and water. H.K. Porter was the largest producer of this kind of locomotive in the United States. For example, the naval shipyard in Brooklyn was served by a huge fleet of steam locomotives of the H.K. Porter 0-6-0T type for several decades.","IDS_PCZC411_NY2020_WORKSHOP":"Floating Workshop","IDS_PCZC411_NY2020_WORKSHOP_DESCRIPTION":"Floating workshops are a special class of auxiliary vessel and watercraft that facilitate the repair of warships, both away from bases and on their territory. These included non-self-propelled repair ships (floating workshops), built in the U.S.A. during World War II at various shipyards as per a standard design. These ships were assigned the YR (Yard Repair) board code. Several floating workshops that underwent repeated refurbishments continued their service until the early 21st century.","IDS_PCZC412_NY2020_305MM":"Triple 305 mm Turret","IDS_PCZC412_NY2020_305MM_DESCRIPTION":"The 305 mm Mark 8 gun, with a barrel length of 50 calibers, was developed in the U.S.A. at the turn of the 1940s, specifically for the large Alaska-class cruisers. In terms of range and penetration capabilities, it surpassed all artillery systems of a similar caliber that were in service anywhere in the world at the time. The gun’s rate of fire was an impressive three rounds per minute, and the weight of the AP projectile created for it was 517 kg. Mark 8 guns were mounted on Alaska-class cruisers in triple turrets weighing over 920 tons.","IDS_PCZC413_NY2020_127MM":"Dual-Purpose 127 mm Mount","IDS_PCZC413_NY2020_127MM_DESCRIPTION":"In the early 1940s, development began on the dual-purpose 127 mm Mark 16 gun that was supposed to replace the Mark 12 gun used at that time on nearly all U.S. warships. The Mark 16 gun barrel was 54 calibers long (compared to 38 calibers for the Mark 12), which provided the new artillery system with greater range and height, while maintaining the same rate of fire. The significant superiority in firepower was complimented by a heavier shell. The guns of this model were mounted on Midway-class aircraft carriers, and were planned as dual-purpose batteries for Montana-class battleships.","IDS_PCZC414_NY2020_OERLIKON":"Oerlikon Anti-Aircraft Machine Gun","IDS_PCZC414_NY2020_OERLIKON_DESCRIPTION":"The famous 20 mm Oerlikon AA machine gun was developed in Switzerland in 1934. However, its initial characteristics didn't impress the largest potential customers—the United States and Great Britain. Ironically, the company was saved from bankruptcy only after having received an order from the Japanese Imperial Navy. In 1939, the gun was improved. Due to the outbreak of World War II, the demand for the new anti-aircraft machine gun grew to a cosmic scale, and the Swiss company could no longer satisfy it. This factor eventually brought the guns' licensed production to the U.S.A. and Great Britain. During the war, in the United States alone, more than 120,000 guns were assembled, making the 20 mm Oerlikon the most numerous anti-aircraft gun of the World War II era.","IDS_PCZC415_NY2020_CURTISS":"Curtiss SC-2 Scout Seaplane","IDS_PCZC415_NY2020_CURTISS_DESCRIPTION":"The order for the development of a new reconnaissance seaplane to replace obsolete aircraft which had entered service in the late 1930s, was issued by the U.S. Navy to the Curtiss company in mid-1942. A specific feature of the new planes had to be their versatility: the easy replacement of their pontoons with wheeled chassis and vice versa made it possible to use them both at ground airfields and on the decks of aircraft carriers, and even with battleship and cruiser catapults. The first vehicles to be produced, which received the SC-1 Seahawk designation, were placed onboard cruiser Guam (Alaska class) in October 1944. An improved SC-2 model with a more powerful engine and better aerodynamics appeared in 1945, when the war was about to end. It would be the last U.S. Navy catapult aircraft.","IDS_PCZC416_NY2020_MK38":"Mk.38 Main Battery Director","IDS_PCZC416_NY2020_MK38_DESCRIPTION":"The battery director, or Mark 38 main battery fire-control tower, has been mounted on American battleships and heavy cruisers since 1941. Equipped with a range finder with an 8-meter base and combined with radar, it became a key element of the most advanced battery fire-control system that existed in the U.S. Navy at that time. Since 1945, the Mark 13 radar antenna has been installed on the director, with a beam capable of detecting a target at a distance of around 40 km.","IDS_PCZC417_NY2020_MK37":"Mk.37 Dual-Purpose Battery Director","IDS_PCZC417_NY2020_MK37_DESCRIPTION":"Fire control of the dual-purpose 127 mm guns widely used in the U.S. Navy was carried out with the help of Mark 37 directors, which became an integral part of American warship architecture in the mid-20th century. The stabilized director \\\"tower\\\", equipped with two range finders, could determine the position of both air and surface targets with high accuracy. During the final stage of World War II, the Mark 25 radar antenna was installed on the director’s roof.","IDS_PCZC418_NY2020_SK2":"SK2 Radar Antenna","IDS_PCZC418_NY2020_SK2_DESCRIPTION":"The SK2 aerial-target detection radar entered service in the U.S. Navy in 1943. Its most noticeable element was a round 5-meter antenna mounted at the highest possible position that the architecture of a ship allowed. The SK2 radar could detect high-flying large targets (e.g. bombers) at distances of up to 230 km. Aircraft trying to hide from the radar by flying at the lowest-possible altitudes could be spotted by the SK2 at distances of around 50 km, determining their position with an accuracy of 100 m.","IDS_PCZC419_NY2020_BOLDTS":"Baldt Anchor","IDS_PCZC419_NY2020_BOLDTS_DESCRIPTION":"Patented in the U.K. in 1821, a stockless anchor that could be pulled into the ship’s hawsehole, and the later Hall anchor, which appeared in 1885, made by casting and with movable arms, revolutionized the history of ship anchors. At the turn of the 20th century, more advanced designs appeared, some of which are still being used. These include the anchor patented in 1898 by American engineer, Frederick Baldt. In the early 20th century, it was adopted as the standard anchor for ships of the U.S. Navy. The anchor retains this status, even now at the beginning of the 21st century.","IDS_PCZC420_KOTS_WINNER":"The Winner","IDS_PCZC420_KOTS_WINNER_DESCRIPTION":"Long live the King!\\n\\nThe title of \\\"King of the Sea\\\" is not the only thing reserved for the winners of this most prestigious tournament, but also honor, respect, and roaring applause (and a hefty haul of Steel, of course)!\\nOnly one team at a time can enjoy the honor of wearing the crown of the King of the Sea, and they keep their title until they have to prove their might again in the next season of the tournament!","IDS_PCZC421_KOTS_WAITING":"The Guy-Who-Is-Always-Late","IDS_PCZC421_KOTS_WAITING_DESCRIPTION":"\\\"Give me a sec!

He spent his entire childhood and youth working on a farm, where he helped his father to herd and shear sheep. During those formative years, Cap mastered playing the mouth organ and ukulele. He even won a prize in a local music festival for young talents!\\n\\nCap's mother knitted fleece socks, and his father sold them at a local market. Together, his parents had a dream: to bring happiness and put smiles on the faces of everyone. For this reason, they decided to make their son a navigator—one who would be able to travel around the world spreading their family socks to its inhabitants. The red-haired guy's passion for the idea increased with each passing day, mostly due to his father's stories about one of their prominent ancestors—a Viking who was a brave seafarer.","IDS_PCZC437_CAPT_1_2_SCHOOL":"Hitting the Books","IDS_PCZC437_CAPT_1_2_SCHOOL_DESCRIPTION":"After graduating from school, Cap entered the Scottish College of Nautical Studies. It was there that he met Big Mary—a lass who held secret affections for him, and who always brought him pasties and helped him with his homework (which, I must add, would later negatively affect his ability to command a ship). Cap regarded Mary as a bosom buddy and was not aware of her true feelings.\\n\\nAfter graduating from college, Cap wanted to work on a merchant ship, so the dream of his parents looked like it would become a reality. But fate would have it another way—he saw a video about the release of a World of Warships update presented by Dasha Perova on TV. Struck by her presence, in that very moment, he made a firm decision to gain her affections by forging himself into a brave Commander of a warship, one who would partake in great battles and defeat all enemies in his path.","IDS_PCZC438_CAPT_1_3_FRIEND":"Friends Do Not Blab","IDS_PCZC438_CAPT_1_3_FRIEND_DESCRIPTION":"In the warm equatorial seas, Cap met Fishy. She became his ultimate friend and mate who would always put him on the right track in any difficult situation.\\n\\nFor some long years, it was believed that Fishy had a natural aptitude for naval science, just because she is... well, a fish. Who could be better than her in understanding the complexities of torpedoes. Later though, other characters from the cast of this story would blab that Fishy was a graduate from the top secret Submarine Academy of the Cyprinoid Fishes, where they teach the intricacies of military and business intelligence, cartography, gunnery, and that most nuanced art of turning a blind eye to the mistakes of others. The unshaken silence of Fishy supported these rumors.","IDS_PCZC439_CAPT_1_4_CAT":"Not an Ordinary Cat","IDS_PCZC439_CAPT_1_4_CAT_DESCRIPTION":"Have you noticed a kitten on the TV? That's the beginning of a big story. Carried away by dreams of becoming an Admiral and enjoying domestic harmony with Dasha, Cap commenced ramming the target and completely forgot that he had a cat! Big Mary had probably promised to take care of him, or perhaps everything was supposed to be arranged differently, but Cat was certain that he had been betrayed and that nobody intended to take him on the Big Voyage. So he decided to take it upon himself to act!\\n\\nFirst, Cat stole onto the naval base, and then breezed (as cats do) on board some ship. He managed to stay out of the crew's sight for some time (as cats also do), but on the third day, the intruder was tricked by his own addiction to tasty snacks—he was caught off-guard in the cook room with an extremely large saucepan between his paws. The crew fell for his feline charms, of course, and he was given refuge and renamed Fluffy. But Cat couldn't stand to be the focus of such mockery, and started planning an act of depredation—he needed a ship of his own to find Cap out in the middle of the ocean.","IDS_PCZC440_CAPT_1_5_TORPEDO":"Operational Record (Annoying Misfortunes)","IDS_PCZC440_CAPT_1_5_TORPEDO_DESCRIPTION":"During World War I, Cap served aboard battleship Agincourt—the ship with the largest number of main battery guns in the entire navy. When, during the course of the Battle of Jutland, the battleship fired a full broadside salvo, the flashes and smoke clouds were so enormous that both allies and enemies alike thought that another battlecruiser had exploded, and so did not pay any attention to what they thought was such an ordinary event. Because of this, Cap's ship received minimal damage—only a fragment from an HE shell smashed a cage in which five polecats resided.\\n\\nAfter the war, the British Navy was scaled down, and Cap received an advanced cruiser named Raleigh. Everything seemed to be just fine, until one day, when Cap was hurrying to reach L'Anse Amour, his ship ran ashore due to dense fog. Earl Beatty, the First Sea Lord, declared that he wouldn't trust Cap to steer even a bum boat. Back to school!\\n\\nBut then World War II broke out. In the very early stages of the war, in one of the countless fjords of the Arctic, Cap's destroyer managed to sneak up on German Tier VIII cruiser Admiral Hipper. The German ship was trying to cap a point, unaware of the approaching threat.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Cap's twofold higher education did not help: he was unlucky, and all of his torpedoes missed their target from point-blank range. Fortunately, Cap always had plenty of high courage. Without a second thought, he accelerated and rammed the enemy! The result of this \\\"bold move\\\" was his ship sinking, while Admiral Hipper escaped with slight shock and some scratches on her paintjob. However, some malicious gossip has it that Cap only rammed because his rudder had jammed.","IDS_PCZC441_CAPT_1_6_BOX":"Operational Record (an Attempt to Retaliate)","IDS_PCZC441_CAPT_1_6_BOX_DESCRIPTION":"As soon as Cap had recovered from his bruises, he decided to try his hand at a new role. The same malicious gossip has it that Cap made a simple decision to stay away from the enemy like a coward, but we will continue to ignore such vile insinuations. He was given command of carrier Ark Royal and immediately set off on a hunt for the arch-villain—battleship Bismarck.\\n\\nCap's airplanes were quick to chase down the enemy and release their torpedoes. But it turned out that it was not the villain he sought, but an allied cruiser—Sheffield. Fortunately, the Commander of the cruiser was a salted sailor, was actually alert, and expected a move of this sort from his allies. So he successfully dodged the torpedoes, all the while yelling out kind curses along the way that some might consider worthy of an officer of such high rank.\\n\\nThat being said, on the second attempt, Cap finally managed to detect Bismarck and successfully torpedo her. Despite not causing much damage, one of the torpedo hits resulted in Bismarck's rudder being jammed. Since Bismarck had already used up her repair kits, she unwillingly turned directly into the paths of battleships King George V and Rodney. Both ships enthusiastically grasped the chance to fill Bismarck with holes and send her to the bottom.\\n\\nBut, just short of half a year later, destiny took her revenge on Cap. An enemy submarine, U-81, scored a single torpedo hit on Cap's ship. It could perhaps have been a minor problem, but the torpedo caused flooding. Cap, similarly to Bismarck some time before, had no repair kits left. It could only have been Karma, they say.","IDS_PCZC442_CAPT_2_1_MUTSUKI":"Destroyers: A Formula for Success","IDS_PCZC442_CAPT_2_1_MUTSUKI_DESCRIPTION":"Cap spent plenty of time studying the art of conducting warfare from behind islands.

So, if you suddenly find yourself in the midst of roaring waves, try to stay behind your allies and never enter the Key Area—it is the most dangerous place on the map!\\n\\nFact no.2—there is no time to explain, but always keep your AA guns on a high alert! Take a deep breath of fresh marine air and keep calm.

This means that heavily armored targets are naturally your top priority.\\n\\nSecond, use the tube-by-tube torpedo firing feature wisely. In the heat of battle, send a torpedo in each direction—one of them will undoubtedly find its target.\\n\\nThird, don't spend your consumables in vain.

Remember that HE shells are good for any warships whose guns are not capable of penetrating a hostile ship's armor.\\n\\nRule #2: Any fires on board your ship must be put out immediately. Fires can slowly but surely (and sometimes even pretty quickly) bring your ship's HP to zero. Don't let that happen—use the Damage Control Party consumable!\\n\\nRule #3: Be bold! Move your team forward in a daring attack, fight fiercely against your opponents—and break through to Key Areas! Your firepower and solid durability make you a supporting rock for your allies.

Yet, it by no means implied that he was so much into applied magic that he would end up elbow deep in filth!\\n\\nHis aim, probably, was to concoct a potion to cast a love-spell on Dasha, or perhaps one to make AP shells bounce off his ship, or even to mix some cursed powder to sprinkle over a captured point to make any pursuing enemies slide outside of its bounds. Perhaps he elaborated on a plot to reach Rank 1, or mixed some flat filter to facilitate his acceptance into a Clan.\\n\\nInstead, by way of his hand, he busted open a portal to an extraordinary world, letting in monster ships of all kinds, followed by a crazed and outraged king.

It turns out that Cap pretty much succeeded in portraying us in the most favorable light before the alien civilization.\\n\\nHe had every chance to fly into outer space to become a human representative of Earth in the Intergalactic Council, particularly in light of the fact that they had already given way to the grand Intergalactic Games! Instead, in exchange for valuable data on us humans, Cap cajoled the aliens into building him an aircraft carrier with a rubber deck to land planes without landing gear, or even a ship that would be able to catch planes on the fly with a crane. Breakthrough space technologies apparently made his mouth water.\\n\\nHe then asked for several miniature nuclear bombs to use against enemy cruisers in open waters—the plan being to throw them at the cruisers until they sank.

The story goes that a tiny Norwegian island called Jan Mayen was home to the base used by an extremely important, yet covert, scientific expedition of four. Some were inclined to believe it was the very place where climatic weapons came into being. Those weapons were expected to help Norway grow into a heavenly garden, turn Greenland green again, and banish any states that were hostile to the descendants of the Vikings to the depths under the deep dark waves. Another widespread rumor was the tired idea that the island housed a meteorological camp, but nobody took it seriously, of course.\\n\\nYet, all shared the idea that it was an extremely valuable expedition, because the unfathomable Professor Falter was determined to set foot on the land of Jan Mayen. The Norwegians sank the German ship by raising a calamitous ridge beneath it, but the Professor managed to get ashore and, laughing and sneering, had almost reached the main secret when, at the very last moment...\\n\\nCap came to the rescue! The destroyer he helmed rushed out of the storm on a straight course towards the island. When another ridge treacherously rose out of the water, Cap's ship went down, but he had jumped into a life boat, reached the shore, climbed the volcano, and defeated the Professor in a straight duel.\\n\\nThe Norwegians took Cap as one of their own, and went on to cheerfully celebrate their unexpected miraculous rescue. The evil Professor, bound hand and foot, had to listen to all five singing the Old Norse sagas in chorus. As time went by, this style of music would eventually be called Doom Death Black Metal.","IDS_PCZC451_CAPT_3_4_NE2":"Conqueror of the Seas","IDS_PCZC451_CAPT_3_4_NE2_DESCRIPTION":"It was in the Mediterranean Sea where Cap earned his first \\\"Kraken Unleashed!\\\"\\n\\nBritain's Chief Spy Center was able to crack the cipher of the Italian seamen and learn what the Italians thought of the \\\"presumptuous Brits\\\". But the British turned out to be much more cunning than presumptuous—they decided to lay a trap for the Italians! The command of this operation was put under the care of the most artful officer in the entire Navy—Cap.\\n\\nIn order to keep the enemy unaware, Cap played golf with the Japanese Consul throughout the whole day before leaving the harbor. Upon finishing another round, he said to the Consul and others present that he was due to return to his flagship—battleship Warspite—to attend a crew party.\\n\\nBut the crew party that was mentioned in all the newspapers turned out to be fake. Under the creeping dusk, the British warships deployed in Greece and Egypt simultaneously set out to sea, switching off their festive fairy lights when in motion. The British had the foresight to mount radars disguised as festive decorations. Now, they were able to detect the enemy even in the blackness of the night.\\n\\nNo surprise then that the enemy was detected. But Cap ordered his forces to sneak up on the enemy squadron, hull-to-hull, and only then light them up with all available searchlights.\\n\\nThe Italians could never have expected such a dirty trick. They had hoped to meet a cluster of unguarded transport ships, but instead they ran into three battleships, seven cruisers, and more than a dozen destroyers. Warspite opened fire from point-blank range. Cruisers Zara, Pola, and Fiume went under, as did destroyers Alfieri and Carducci. Those ships that survived, in the wake of the injured battleship Vittorio Veneto, returned to Italy, and long after remained afraid to stick their noses out of their naval bases.","IDS_PCZC452_CAPT_3_5_BEEP":"Cat's Sudden Appearance","IDS_PCZC452_CAPT_3_5_BEEP_DESCRIPTION":"Have you ever really wanted to take revenge on someone?

Or at least on a throne, a throne mounted on a battleship! Cat also wanted all of this, and he succeeded in getting it! Anyway, at least it seemed that way to him.\\n\\nBeing a representative of the trend-setting youth and an active explorer of the internet, Cat challenged Cap to a musical battle on board their ships. As we all know, Cap was not the type to ever reject a challenge. He installed the best possible sound system on his ship, and, together with Fishy, met Cat's challenge in style.\\n\\nDuring the battle, anything that was capable of producing some kind of musical sound was utilized—horns in particular. \\\"Tu-duuuu, Be-beeep, Vrooom-vrooom\\\"—the symphony was broadcast on all available frequencies, even the most secret ones, and crowds of fan ships filled up the dance-floor zone.\\n\\nAs in any other good story with a happy ending, their friendship triumphed. Although, Cat was sure that he had put Cap in his place. Following this magnificent musical event, the main characters made peace, and it is said that they are preparing a collaborative feat.","IDS_PCZC453_CAPT_3_6_OLD":"Admiral on Merit","IDS_PCZC453_CAPT_3_6_OLD_DESCRIPTION":"On the eve of 1944, off the North Cape, Cap gained standout success. A cruiser squadron that included his own ship, Belfast, was supposed to repel enemy battleship Scharnhorst from the convoy and keep it spotted until battleship Duke of York ran across her. During the polar night, while the storm and its blizzards were playing havoc, Cap was able to score an accurate hit directly on Scharnhorst's radio locator on his first shot.\\n\\nThe same anonymous ill-wishers (yes, those already familiar to us) say that hitting the radar—the ship's highest point—meant that Cap made an error of several kilometers in determining the distance to his target, so his hit was a ridiculous coincidence! \\\"Ha-ha-ha!\\\" is our response to the ill-wishers.\\n\\nAfter such success, Cap was assigned as Commander of the last-in-history battleship Vanguard. The young Queen of England, upon the occasion of her crowning, decided to take a round-the-world voyage on board a yacht. But an ordinary yacht seemed to be somewhat banal to Her Majesty. As such, she ruled that the largest, mightiest, and most spectacular ship of the Navy—battleship Vanguard—should have the honor of serving as her yacht.\\n\\nDuring the long trip, Cap was sparkling with his fine manners, courtesy, wit, knowledge of court ceremonies, personal valor, and gallantry. The Queen was impressed beyond words. Soon after the cruise was over, Cap was promoted to Admiral, received the title of Peer and a position in the British Admiralty.","IDS_PCZC454_CAPT_4_1_LADY":"Cap's Romantic Fantasy","IDS_PCZC454_CAPT_4_1_LADY_DESCRIPTION":"Every little boy dreams of becoming a hero! Especially one who was born with all the right qualities! Our Cap is strong, fast, and never cools down after a battle.\\n\\nBesides that, Cap was always absorbed in books about heroic seafarers. Actually, not only about seafarers, but simply, heroic novels. Following the examples of his favorite historical characters who were dressed in velvet camisoles with lacelike cuffs, he is convinced that a real knight and gentleman cannot live another day without performing a gallant deed devoted to a fair lady. For this reason, daily after breakfast, having powdered his wig and polished his lacquered shoes after the latest French fashion, he heads out every day to serve a lady.\\n\\nIt should be also noted that the presence of the lady herself is not required at all, her beautiful image is reason enough for our hero to accomplish a feat. If the plot needs it, Cap can play the role of the damsel in distress himself, who he would eventually shield from danger.

Cap was fully prepared and equipped for the circumstances, and he had also mastered the art of applying warpaint in advance by watching movies.\\n\\nHe would frequently imagine how he would make his way through the wild woods and overcome a bear in hand-to-hand combat. He thought about how he would invent new ways to mend holes in ship hulls with the help of five strobiles and his own brutality. And then he got the perfect chance to reinforce his skills!\\n\\nAfter making a small camp on the beach, Cap uprooted a tree and chopped it up into firewood. He then made breakfast from representatives of the local flora and fauna. After such a productive day, our hero decided to take a short nap.\\n\\nA strange sound woke him up—it came from a landing spacecraft. It was obvious that the crew were not very friendly. The scene was set—the hunters wanted him as their prey. Having placed several traps and trip wires across the whole island, Cap took the fight to the aliens. Who was the winner?

Cap's irrepressible fantasy and Fishy's fine sense of humor are capable of creating the most enchanting spectacles out of the most ordinary situations. Fishy does not need words to express her attitude towards all that is happening in a bright manner or scenic gesture. She is not free of attractiveness and charm, which definitely adds to the fascination of this duet.\\n\\nWhat a multitude of roles Fishy has taken on!

Soon after he graduated from the Naval Academy, our red-bearded seafarer was offered to appear in the \\\"Bad Advice\\\" video series. As it turned out, during the film shoot, it was a documentary rather than an ordinary movie. Cap acted as himself—a fearless and a somewhat simple-minded hero.\\n\\nThe pilot series, with Cap as its leading character, was a roaring success. The producers immediately planned a second season to follow, and the principal naval YouTube channel, World of Warships, ordered the production of a spinoff titled \\\"Naval Traditions\\\". Cap was much in demand—he was invited to meetings and supper parties, and was even filmed in a music video. He was nicknamed \\\"Hollywood's Naval King\\\", almost the same nickname as one \\\"little-known\\\" actor at the beginning of the 20th century.\\n\\nIt's a poor soldier who never wants to become a general. For that reason, as with other celebrity from the film industry, Cap has his sights set on winning an Oscar as an independent director and actor.

At least Fishy, and Cap himself, tell the same story. That's why Cap's biography has this record, word for word.\\n\\n\\\"That must have all happened,\\\" thought Cap while submerging into the depths of the sea. His meeting with Neptune awaited him, and Neptune would certainly demand an explanation about his numerous mischiefs. However, no reasonable excuses popped into Cap's head—he had even fewer ideas than usual. Our hero was fascinated by the look of the underwater realm. Everything around him looked extraordinary. But he had quite quickly gotten used to wearing the aquarium that Fishy had given him (with unabashed delight, we might add) on his head.\\n\\nBut the real discovery that shook him to his core was the fact that he could suddenly hear Fishy's voice.\\n\\nCap was so overwhelmed that he didn't realize at first what Fishy was actually talking about. Only some disparate words and phrases got through to him, something like \\\"think for oneself\\\", \\\"responsibility\\\", \\\"true seaman\\\", \\\"immaturity\\\", and \\\"special assignment\\\".

By early 1905, the project had the features of a ship with uniform main battery guns.\\n\\nInformation about battleship Dreadnought being built in the U.K. motivated the German Empire to come up with an adequate response. In the summer of 1907, the laying down of the first four German dreadnoughts took place, and less than 3 years later, all of them became part of the nation's navy.","IDS_PCZC484_GF097_DRESDEN":"SMS Dresden","IDS_PCZC484_GF097_DRESDEN_DESCRIPTION":"Cruiser Dresden, laid down in 1906 and named after the capital city of Saxony, was built as an experimental ship in some ways. She was one of the first capital warships of the Kaiser's navy to be equipped with steam turbines.\\n\\nHer sister ship, the legendary Emden, had a more archaic propulsion system—triple-expansion steam engines. Both cruisers entered service between 1908 and 1909. During World War I, both ships joined the East Asia squadron commanded by Admiral von Spee, and both perished in battle against British ships.","IDS_PCZC485_GF097_LEBERECHTMAASS":"Leberecht Maass","IDS_PCZC485_GF097_LEBERECHTMAASS_DESCRIPTION":"Commissioned in January 1937, Leberecht Maass became the pioneer of the majority of Kriegsmarine's destroyers. The six series of ships that followed basically repeated the primary specific features of their prototype—the size, outline profile, arrangement, and type of propulsion.\\n\\nThe destroyer was named after an admiral who perished in the Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1914. The operational record of Leberecht Maass was short—in February 1940, the destroyer exploded and sank after hitting a British mine.","IDS_PCZC486_GF097_U69":"Type VII Submarine","IDS_PCZC486_GF097_U69_DESCRIPTION":"Type VII U-boats were the most common ships of this type. Over the period of a decade, between 1935 and 1945, more than 700 Type VIIs were built.\\n\\nDuring World War II, these very submarines became the most dreaded and effective weapon of the Kriegsmarine. Relatively small, with a displacement of around 800 tons when submerged, and with a crew of below fifty men, they terrified the warships and cargo ships of the Allies wherever they appeared.","IDS_PCZC487_GF097_TIRPITZ":"Tirpitz","IDS_PCZC487_GF097_TIRPITZ_DESCRIPTION":"Time after time, Britain made strenuous efforts to destroy this formidable German battleship, which never encountered enemy ships in battle.\\n\\nIn November 1944, as the result of a raid by British bombers carrying super-heavy 5.5-ton bombs, the battleship was finally sunk. Heinrich Ehrler—an ex-fighter ace and holder of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves—was responsible for the AA cover of the ship. For his failure, he was put on trial and sentenced to capital punishment, which was later reduced to imprisonment in a fortress.","IDS_PCZC488_GF097_GRAFZEPPELIN":"Graf Zeppelin","IDS_PCZC488_GF097_GRAFZEPPELIN_DESCRIPTION":"With every chance of becoming the Kriegsmarine's sole full-fledged strike aircraft carrier, Graf Zeppelin was built twice.\\n\\nThe first time, construction on the imminently-ready ship ceased in the spring of 1940—the ship's artillery was sent to defend Norway, which had been occupied shortly beforehand, and the gun fire control system was sold to the U.S.S.R. However, the Taranto Raid, air attacks on Bismarck, and finally the attack on Pearl Harbor made a strong impression on the Kriegsmarine command, and they decided that Germany needed an aircraft carrier of its own.\\n\\nTwo years of desolation later, in the spring of 1942, work on the ship resumed, but then ceased again at the beginning of the next year, when the naval strategy changed. Surface warship forces were completely removed from the Third Reich's shipbuilding priorities.","IDS_PCZC489_GF097_IMPERIALSAILOR":"Sailor of the Imperial German Navy","IDS_PCZC489_GF097_IMPERIALSAILOR_DESCRIPTION":"The Imperial German Navy, or Kaiserliche Marine, was established in 1871 following the unification of the country and the creation of the German Empire.\\n\\nFor the first two decades, the German Navy played a relatively modest role in Europe, their primary goals being the maintenance of the nation's prestige and provision of coastal defense. By 1888, the year of Emperor Wilhelm II's ascent to the throne, the personnel of the Kaiserliche Marine comprised slightly more than sixteen thousand sailors and officers.","IDS_PCZC490_GF097_IMPERIALOFFICER":"Officer of the Imperial German Navy","IDS_PCZC490_GF097_IMPERIALOFFICER_DESCRIPTION":"A turning point in the history of the Imperial German Navy came in 1898 when, shortly before being appointed as Secretary of State of the German Imperial Naval Office, Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz submitted a draft project for the development of the country's naval forces to the Emperor.\\n\\nThe Tirpitz Plan was intended as nothing more than a confrontation with Great Britain, the leading naval power in the world. In 1914, after 15 years of intensive warship construction, Germany was capable of sending a fleet out to sea with a total tonnage of over one million tons.","IDS_PCZC491_GF097_KRSAILOR1":"Kriegsmarine Sailor in Full Dress Uniform","IDS_PCZC491_GF097_KRSAILOR1_DESCRIPTION":"After the defeat in World War I, in accordance with the conditions of the Treaty of Versailles, the German navy was in fact returned to its \\\"initial state\\\" of coastal forces. The country was allowed to preserve a handful of old ships.\\n\\nThe personnel of the Navy of the German Republic, the Reichsmarine, was limited to 15,000, which was the level of the German Navy during the 1880s. The years of hard work that followed were aimed at training specialists and maintaining the shipbuilding industry at an adequate technological level.\\n\\nThe new phase of naval development started in 1935, when the Kriegsmarine was founded as the naval force of the Third Reich.","IDS_PCZC492_GF097_KRSAILOR2":"Kriegsmarine Sailor","IDS_PCZC492_GF097_KRSAILOR2_DESCRIPTION":"A senior seaman, or Obergefreiter, of the Kriegsmarine in naval duty uniform. For convenience, when carrying out work on the deck or around the guns and mechanisms, the Schiffchen-type side cap was introduced in 1938, and was worn both by officers and sailors. It was most often seen aboard U-boats where it turned out to be the most practical.","IDS_PCZC493_GF097_KROFFICER":"Kriegsmarine Officer","IDS_PCZC493_GF097_KROFFICER_DESCRIPTION":"Oberleutnant zur See in his \\\"light\\\" duty uniform—a dark double-breasted jacket without shoulder marks, and a summertime peaked cap.\\n\\nThe duty uniform of the Kriegsmarine's officers differed in just a few details from the uniform of the Imperial German Navy's officers.\\n\\nCrowns disappeared or were replaced with stars, Third Reich insignia were introduced, and the stand-up collar gave way to a turn-down collar.","IDS_PCZC494_GF097_KRADMIRAL":"Kriegsmarine Admiral","IDS_PCZC494_GF097_KRADMIRAL_DESCRIPTION":"The full dress, or parade military uniform, of the Kriegsmarine's officers had several variants. It could be worn with shoulder marks made from curl cord, or archaic-but-still-accepted epaulets.\\n\\nDepending on the level of dignity of the occasion, the decorations were worn either in their full size, or were replaced with a medal ribbon bar. The belt could be either a white parade belt or a dark repp belt. The parade uniform was often worn together with bladed weapons—a dagger as a rule.\\n\\nHowever, in certain cases, especially when wearing the epaulets, admirals were supposed to hang an officer's sword on their belts.","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_APRIL_SPACE":"Space","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_APRIL_SPACE_SET_SKIN_TOOLTIP":"Display the unique exterior of space-themed ships in battle and in the Port","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_APRIL_SPACE_TAKE_OFF_SKIN_TOOLTIP":"Hide the unique exterior of space-themed ships in battle and in the Port","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_ARCTIC":"Battle of the North Cape","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_ARCTIC_SET_SKIN_TOOLTIP":"Display the unique Arctic camouflages in battle and in the Port","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_ARCTIC_TAKE_OFF_SKIN_TOOLTIP":"Hide the unique Arctic camouflages in battle and in the Port","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_ARPEGGIO":"Arpeggio","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_ARPEGGIO_HIDE_SHIP_TOOLTIP":"Hide ships from \\\"ARPEGGIO OF BLUE STEEL -ARS NOVA-\\\" in the carousel","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_ARPEGGIO_SET_SKIN_TOOLTIP":"Display the unique camouflages of the ships from \\\"ARPEGGIO OF BLUE STEEL -ARS NOVA-\\\" in battle and in the Port","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_ARPEGGIO_SHOW_SHIP_TOOLTIP":"Display ships from \\\"ARPEGGIO OF BLUE STEEL -ARS NOVA-\\\" in the carousel","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_ARPEGGIO_TAKE_OFF_SKIN_TOOLTIP":"Hide the unique camouflages of the ships from \\\"ARPEGGIO OF BLUE STEEL -ARS NOVA-\\\" in battle and in the Port","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_AZURLANE":"Azur Lane","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_AZURLANE_SET_SKIN_TOOLTIP":"Display the special camouflage of the Azur Lane ships in battle and in the Port","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_AZURLANE_TAKE_OFF_SKIN_TOOLTIP":"Hide the special camouflage of the Azur Lane ships in battle and in the Port","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_BISMARCK_EVENT":"The Hunt for Bismarck","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_BISMARCK_EVENT_SET_SKIN_TOOLTIP":"Display the special camouflage for the ships suitable for \\\"The Hunt for Bismarck\\\" campaign in battle and in the Port","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_BISMARCK_EVENT_TAKE_OFF_SKIN_TOOLTIP":"Hide the special camouflage for the ships suitable for \\\"The Hunt for Bismarck\\\" campaign in battle and in the Port","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_CH_DRAGONS":"Lunar New Year","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_CH_DRAGONS_HIDE_SHIP_TOOLTIP":"Hide Lunar New Year ships in the carousel","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_CH_DRAGONS_SET_SKIN_TOOLTIP":"Display the unique camouflages of the Lunar New Year ships in battle and in the Port","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_CH_DRAGONS_SHOW_SHIP_TOOLTIP":"Display Lunar New Year ships in the carousel","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_CH_DRAGONS_TAKE_OFF_SKIN_TOOLTIP":"Hide the unique camouflages of the Lunar New Year ships in battle and in the Port","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_COLORED":"Painting","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_COLORED_SET_SKIN_TOOLTIP":"Display unique camouflages in battle and in the Port","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_COLORED_TAKE_OFF_SKIN_TOOLTIP":"Hide unique camouflages in battle and in the Port","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_DECORATIVE":"Decorative","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_DECORATIVE_SET_SKIN_TOOLTIP":"Display unique camouflages in battle and in the Port","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_DECORATIVE_TAKE_OFF_SKIN_TOOLTIP":"Hide unique camouflages in battle and in the Port","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_FREEDOM":"Go Navy!","IDS_PECULARITY_FILTER_FREEDOM_SET_SKIN_TOOLTIP":"Display the unique Go Navy!
